            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TWO Great Men being at this time Employ'd in Writing the Hiſtory of our King; 'tis for their moſt Excellent Pieces the Publick ought to reſerve their Admiration, mine being, in compariſon of theirs, but an Eſſay. It is from their moſt Skilful Pen, the Curious muſt expect to be enlightned in Matters of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Moment, I being ready to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the whole to their Judgment. It is to them I appeal, as to the true Judges of Hiſtory; and what Difficulties are to be ſurmounted, to merit the Name of a good Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian. His Stile ought to be live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and natural, and to have an equal mixture of Sweetneſs and Purity;
<pb facs="tcp:95697:3"/>He ought to have an equal Share of Wit and Judgment, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Matters with the utmoſt Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and an undaunted Courage, to unmask Vice, and give due Praiſe to vertuous Actions. Theſe great Talents requiſite in an Hiſtorian, made me tremble at the very Thougts of this Undertaking, till a certain Friend of mine, a Perſon of extraordinary Merits and Parts, did in ſome meaſure recover me from the Fear that ſeiſed me, repreſenting to me, that ſuch a Combination of Perfections muſt be conſidered and numbred among thoſe imaginary Accompliſhments, which are made uſe of in Sciences, to encourage us to ſuch great Undertakings, as are ſought after by many, but attained to by few. But if it be ſo great a Task to write a general Hiſtory, how much more difficult is it to write the Hiſtory of our Time, to give it a true Reliſh, that agreeable
<pb facs="tcp:95697:3"/>Variety, and other Embelliſhments, by which the antient Hiſtorians have rendred their Names ſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to Poſterity. They had frequent Opportunities to give moſt ample Demonſtrations of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, in theſe magnificent Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, which are to be met with in their Works, under the <hi>Names</hi> of their Great Captains, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they Engaged in Battle, uſed to Animate their Troops, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to them the Juſtice of their Cauſe, and to Encourage them with certain hopes of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. Our Princes and Generals have laid aſide this Way of Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves to their Soldiers, which takes away from our Modern Hiſtorians the Advantage of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhing their Hiſtorical Relations with theſe agreeable Diverſions and Events, which ſurpriſe the Reader, and which are of no ſmall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take away the Tediouſneſs
<pb facs="tcp:95697:4"/>of the Relations of the many Sieges and Battles, which happen in a long War, without any other mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of pleaſing Varieties. When the antient Hiſtorians repreſent to us a Great Miniſter of State in the Cabinet of his Prince; or an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Wiſe Senatours delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Council concerning ſome Affairs of the greateſt Moment, they lay hold of this Opportunity to unfold the whole Myſtery of the Matrer, and to lay it open to the view of the Reader, and by their different Advice, to diſcover all the Craft and Intrigues of the moſt refined Politicians. Theſe pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſcoveries have a ſecret Charm which is infinitely pleaſing to many, who meaſure the Ability of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian by his Inſight into Matters of State, and by his diving into the Events of Things, from far fetch'd Cauſes. A Prejudice common to the greateſt Part of Mankind, who
<pb facs="tcp:95697:4"/>imagine that Princes never act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Inclinations, but are only guided by ſome more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Motives; juſt as if Great Men by being placed in a high Station, were diveſted of theſe Paſſions incident to the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But howſoever it be, it is unqueſtionable, that he who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give us a Hiſtory of our Time, cannot in any wiſe pretend to give entire Satisfaction to theſe conceited Politicians. For how is it poſſible to imagine, that a private Perſon ſhould be able to diſcover the Secrets of the Cabinets of Princes, which Time only can bring to light? And ſuppoſing ſome of them were by chance come to his Knowledge, with what face could he publiſh them to the World? From whence it is evident, that all what is to be expected from an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian, who writes the Hiſtory of our Time, is to give us as faithful
<pb facs="tcp:95697:5"/>Relation as poſſible can be, of the Events of Things, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to the Reader in their due order and places, and to inſert their Cauſes as far as they came to his Knowledge. This is the whole Deſign of this Treatiſe, to wit, to repreſent to the Reader a true Idea of the Reign of our King, which may ſerve them as a Guide to their own Judgment, what Rank this Great Monarch deſerves to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in among thoſe Great Men, whom God has raiſed up from time to time, for the Felicity of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Glory of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. For theſe thirty Years laſt paſt, our King has been the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all <hi>Europe,</hi> even his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies not refuſing to pay due Praiſes to His Great Actions; and theſe Powerful and unſucceſsful Leagues againſt <hi>France,</hi> are the moſt Glorious and undeniable Inſtances not only of his Strength, but alſo of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Great Qualifications.</p>

               </note> With what an univerſal ſatisfaction this welcome News was received all over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is eaſier to be imagined than expreſt. The rejoycings made upon this occaſion, did in a great meaſure obliterate the glory of famous Victories, obtained about the ſame time by the <hi>French</hi> over their Enemies, the people of <hi>France</hi> looking upon them all at that juncture as ſcarce worth taking notice of, and of little conſequence, in compariſon of the advantages they promiſed themſelves from the happy birth of a <hi>Dauphin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The barrenneſs of the Queen, and the ill ſtate of the King's health had given occaſion to ſeveral Cabals and Factions; and no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was one head of this pernicious <hi>Hydra</hi> cut off, but another appeared in its ſtead, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the Great ones being riſen to that pitch, as to threaten the ruine of the whole Kingdom, if, by the auſpicious Birth of this Prince, theſe dreadful Clouds had not been diſperſed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Troubles during his Minority.</note> But the Death of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIIIth which happened when the young Prince was but four Years and nine Months old, occaſioned no ſmall apprehenſions of future troubles in the State; great diſcontents reigned among the Nobility; the Parliaments were exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many provocations, and the People exhauſted by heavy Impoſitions; all which, it was feared, would have broke out into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Rebellion, during the young King's Minority.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cardinal</hi> Julius Mazarin.</note> The Queen Regent being abſolutely ſatisfied in the ability of the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> had made him Chief Miniſter of State, to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95697:22"/>great diſſatisfaction of ſuch of the Great ones, as propoſed to themſelves to fiſh in troubled Waters, and to find their account in foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diviſions in the Kingdom; They alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Cardinal being a Foreigner, they did not queſtion but that he would tread the footſteps of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and in this high ſtation revived the ſame haughty Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims his Predeceſſor had made uſe of during his Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>But this great Miniſter of State managed matters with ſo much dexterity, that by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing ample favours, and larger promiſes upon thoſe of the diſcontented Party, he brought many of them over to his ſide, ſo that beyond all expectation, his Miniſtry was very quiet for the firſt five years, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition of the Kingdom appear'd to be more flouriſhing at that time,

The <hi>French</hi> gained 5 Victories by Land, and 2 at Sea; and beſides, they made themſelves Maſters of 10 or 12 places of no ſmall Importance.</p>
            <p>But this proſperity was of no long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The exceſſive Ambition and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Envy and Jealouſies which reigned among the Nobility; the pretended Zeal of ſome of the <hi>French</hi> Parliaments, encouraged by the Favour and Acclamations of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, which being inveigled with the hopes of an abatement of the heavy Taxes they groaned under, followed blindfold the inclinations of their Leaders. Add to this the want of Courage in the Chief Miniſter, which induced him to lay hold of that moſt deſtructive Maxim of State; <hi>To prefer
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95697:23"/>only ſuch as he dreaded moſt;</hi> This fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of different Intereſts and Paſſions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſource of ſuch diviſions and inteſtine Commotions, as ſhook the very foundation of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Kingdom was involved in theſe Troubles, the King's Education was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner neglected by thoſe to who's Tuition it was committed, who made it their chiefeſt care to carry the young King from one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to another, to ſhew him to his People, in hopes to reſtore, by this laſt effort, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd and languiſhing Authority of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and by his Royal Prefence to keep them in Obedience.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe Obſtacles,
<note place="margin">Happy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his Youth.</note> the King began to give moſt evident proofs of his great and generous Inclinations; for when he was ſcarce twelve years of Age, ſuch was his happy Genius, that there appeared a diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reſervedneſs in all his Actions, much above what could be expected from ſo tender an Age, ſhewing not the leaſt inclination to thoſe things which are the ordinary diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Children, but an uncommon eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be inſtructed in all manner of Exerciſes, and a ſingular delight in hearing the relations of great and memorable Exploits. Theſe were the chief Entertainments of his Youth; and it was always obſerved, that if any thing happened to be related to him, that was either above the common rate in its undertaking, or ſurpriſing in its event, there appear'd ſuch a ſprightlineſs in his Eves and whole Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as ſufficiently teſtified his deſire of ſignalizing himſelf by ſome memorable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Lewis <hi>of</hi> Bourbon, II <hi>Prince of</hi> Conde.</note> The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had for the laſt ſix years paſt been the Hero and chief Supporter of the Royal Party; It was he that had gain'd the Battles of <hi>Rocroy, Fribourg, Nortlingen,</hi> and <hi>Lentz;</hi> And it was alſo the ſame Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who at the beginning of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine commotions was ſo fortunate, or rather dextrous, as to block up the City of <hi>Paris</hi> with 7 or 8000 Men.
<note place="margin">1649.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There was ſomething great and ſublime above the reſt of Mankind in this Prince: He was endowed with a Courage undaunted in the midſt of all Dangers; His skill in Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affairs was beyond what can be imagined or expreſs'd. On the day of Battle nothing was comparable to his Conduct, either in chooſing the advantage of the Ground, or ordering and diſpoſing his Troops in order of Battle, or retiring and ſuſtaining them with freſh Forces; no body beyond him in puſhing on an Attack with the utmoſt Vigour, and in the heat of the Engagement to poſſeſs himſelf of an advantageous Poſt, and to change the diſpoſition of his Troops according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95697:24"/>accidents and revolutions of the Battle; a happy conjunction of many extraordinary Qualities, if thoſe great Souls, elevated above the common Sphere, were alſo capable of moderation. His aſpiring Genius nouriſhed by evil Counſels, prompted him to take up Arms againſt the King, and having aſſembled a Body of Troops, after ſeveral marches and counter-marches, he at laſt poſted himſelf near St. <hi>Cloue,</hi> truſting to the nearneſs of the Bridge, which might ſerve him for a ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, to avoid an engagement, in caſe he ſhould be attack'd by his Enemies, who were ſuperiour in number to him.</p>
            <p>The two Marſhals, <hi>de Turenne,</hi> and <hi>de la Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> commanded two ſeparate Bodies, who, to make ſure work, intended to incloſe him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their two Armies, which the Prince ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoon taken notice of, he broke up from St. <hi>Cloue</hi> with an intention to march to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton,</hi> and to entrench himſelf near that Bridge, where, by the nearneſs of the two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Seyne</hi> and <hi>Marne,</hi> it would be impoſſible to force his Camp. The ſhorteſt way was to march thro' <hi>Paris,</hi> but fearing leaſt his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould be conſiderably diminiſh'd by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion in his march thro' the City, or that the Citizens might deny him a Paſſage, he changed his reſolution, and ordered his Troops to march round about as near the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs as poſſibly could be. He marched with all poſſible ſpeed and precaution, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which,
<note place="margin">Henry de la Tour d'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne, <hi>Vicount of</hi> en ne.</note> the Viſcount of <hi>Turenne</hi> having got timely notice of it, followed him ſo cloſely, that after ſome hours march, he attack'd him in the Rear, and obliged him to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95697:24"/>come to an Engagement. It was a happy chance for the Prince to meet with ſome old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments formerly caſt up at the entrance of the Suburbs of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> behind which he poſted his Troops to make head againſt the approaching Enemy. He had ſcarce had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fure to put them in order of Battle, when the King's Army, animated by his Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, attack'd his Entrenchments with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible bravery. As the King was at that time not much above 13 years of Age, thoſe that were about him could not ſufficiently admire with what greatneſs of Courage, and without ſhewing the leaſt ſymptoms of fear he was an Eye-witneſs of the Engagement. It was the greateſt pleaſure in the World to obſerve the various changes in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the effects of the different tranſports and motions of his Soul, ſometimes leaping for joy when he ſaw his Victorious Troops beat back thoſe of the Prince, ſometimes bluſhing, not ſo much for indignation as ſhame, when the Prince forced the Royaliſts to retreat. As in Civil Wars both parties are moſt incenſed with mutual animoſities, ſo the braveſt of both the Armies ſignalized themſelves by ſome remarkable Action or other, every one being prodigal of his Life to purchaſe Honour in this firſt encounter, and to ſnatch the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory out of his Enemy's Hands, which thus remained uncertain for ſome time, till after a bloody Combat of two hours fortune declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the King, whoſe Troops having made themſelves Maſters of the Entrenchments, marched in good Order thro' the great Street of the Suburbs without any oppoſition from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95697:25"/>the Prince. But ſcarce had they advanced half way towards the City, when on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den they ſaw the Prince again appear at the head of his braveſt Volunteers, and other choſen Troops, who charged them ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, that they forced them to retreat, and to ſeek for ſhelter in the ſame Retrenchments from whence they had ſo lately forced their Enemies. This varions chance of Fortune changed the whole face of the Battle, and it was very difficult to judge on which ſide Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory would encline, both parties fighting with an equal animoſity and bravery, till the Viſcount of <hi>Turenne</hi> being reinforced with ſome freſh Troops who had forced their way thro' ſome other Streets into the Suburbs, encloſed the Prince on all ſides, who muſt have been Sacrificed, with his whole Army to the fury of his Enemies, if the City of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> had not opened its Gates for his Reception, and by the help of the great Artillery from the Baſtile, forced the King's Troops out of the Suburbs.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had upon many other occaſions given moſt ſignal proofs of his Valour and Conduct, but according to the judgment of the moſt expert Maſters of the Art of War, this day was accounted the moſt remarkable and moſt glorious of his Life, if it may be allowed that true Glory is to be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in bearing Arms againſt his Sovereign; it being unqueſtionable, that he appear'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter'd his Enemies in all places where the danger was moſt preſſing, and that he ſhew'd as much Prudence and Conduct in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as Vigour in the execution of them.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95697:25"/>The Victorious Viſcount of <hi>Turenne</hi> himſelf ſeem'd to be envious of the extraordinary Conduct and Courage of his vanquiſh'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and the King having received an exact relation of what had paſſed, could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſpeak highly in praiſe of the Prince, and for 2 or 3 days after, his Valour was the only ſubject of his diſcourſe, an evident ſign that from his infancy he had a moſt paſſionate inclination for Glory, and a moſt fervent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of making himſelf remarkable by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Actions.</p>

               <note place="margin">He goes to the Camp.</note> This noble Fire daily encreaſing in his Soul, it was in vain for his Friends to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to him, on one ſide, the fatigues which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Camp, and on the other ſide, the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity there was to manage a health ſo precious as his, to the beſt advantage; all theſe arguments were not prevailing enough to keep him at home, but maugre all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions to the contrary, he appear'd every Year in the Campaign at the head of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and there was ſcarce any memorable Siege in <hi>Flanders</hi> till the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Peace, where he did not encourage his Troops by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>It was obſervable, that whilſt he was in the Camp, he ſhow'd more gaiety in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and all his Actions, than he did in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other place.

There was nothing to be ſeen at Court but Balls and Feaſting, every one ſtriving to out-vie the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in magnificence, in which, as well as in his Perſon, the King ſurpaſſed all the reſt.</p>
            <p>He was then betwixt nineteen and twenty Years of Age, large of Stature, his Mien and Phyſiognomy carrying along with it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary and great, with all the true marks of Honour and Vertue, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in his Countenance a moſt agreeable mixture of Majeſty and Sweetneſs. The firſt time the Queen of <hi>Sueden</hi> came in his Preſence ſhe had her Eyes fix'd upon him during the whole Interview; and ſhe had ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an eſteem ever after for his Perſon, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after her return to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe could not forbear to ſpeak highly in his praiſe, and to declare to all that came to ſee her, that ſhe thought her ſelf amply rewarded for the trouble of her journey into <hi>France,</hi> by the ſight of that Prince, and that his merits infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſurpaſſed the reputation he had acquir'd abroad.</p>
            <p>Theſe loud acclamations from far diſtant Countries, were received in <hi>France</hi> with the more ſatisfaction, the more the King was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by the People, who look'd upon theſe his noble Qualities, as ſo many pledges and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95697:27"/>happy Preſages of the future proſperity of his Reign. But as the hopes of the whole Kingdom ſeem'd to be center'd in his Perſon, ſo all was fill'd with confuſion when ſoon after he fell ſo dangerouſly ill,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>He falls ſick at</hi> Calais, July 1, 1658. June 25th 1658.</note> as to be given over by his Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>After the taking of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in Triumph, he ſtay'd 5 or 6 days in the Fort of <hi>Mardick,</hi> which being a ſmall place, and at that time ſo full of Soldiers, that they wanted both convenient Lodgings and other Neceſſaries, moſt of them were ſick, which having cauſed an Infection, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the King, to what danger he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Perſon in thus tarrying ſo long in a place where he was ſurrounded on all ſides with ſick Soldiers; but notwithſtanding all theſe Remonſtrances, he would not retire from thence till he had given the neceſſary Orders, according to his firſt intention. From thence he went to <hi>Calais,</hi> where he had ſcarce been a few Hours, but he began to feel the direful effects of the contagious Air, which, as it was believed, he had taken at <hi>Mardick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be ſhort, he was ſeized with a moſt dangerous Feaver, which he ſtriving to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the firſt two days, he was on the fourth day judg'd to be paſt remedy. It is impoſſible to find Words ſuitable to the Grief that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd not only in the whole Court, but in the Countenance of the People; neither ought the Tears which were ſhed ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon this occaſion, to be looked upon as the effects of a feigned Zeal, as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens on ſuch like occaſions in ſome Countries, where the Subjects are forced to appear far
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95697:28"/>different from what they are, and hide their ſatisfaction under the mask of a pretended grief; no, theſe were the true Interpreters of their Hearts, every one being in fear of loſing ſo good a King and Maſter. The Queen Mother who loved him moſt tenderly, and who ſaw her ſelf in danger of loſing her main ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, did not ſtir from his Bed ſide day or night. In the height of his illneſs he would ſeveral times endeavour to comfort her, but this tenderneſs of the Son only ſerved to make more lively impreſſions of ſorrow in the Mother.</p>
            <p>Some at Court having heard much diſcourſe of a certain famous Phyſician then living at <hi>Abbeville,</hi> he was ſent for. After he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the King's Diſtemper, he told them, that in the condition he was at preſent, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an Emetick could ſave his Life. The Word Emetick made them all tremble for fear, this Remedy in thoſe days being looked upon as new and not well approved of, and conſequently conſider'd as extreamly dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, which made it to be debated for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, whether it was fit to be given to the King or not, eſpecially ſince his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, jealous of him that had preſcribed the Remedy, oppoſed it with all their might. But the King having abſolutely reſign'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the diſpoſal of God Almighty, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an extraordinary compoſure of mind the iſſue of his Diſtemper, without the leaſt ſigns of being diſſatisfied with his deſtiny, which was likely to ſnatch him away in the very flower of his Age. Before he took the Vomit he order'd all the chief Men of his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95697:28"/>Court to be admitted into his Bed-Chamber, where having with a compoſed and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Countenance taking his laſt farewel of them, he asked for the Glaſs which contained the Emetick, and took off the whole Doſe at one Draught. After two Hours the Emetick. began to work ſo ſucceſsfully, and to evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſuch a quantity of the Morbifick matter, that there began to be ſome hopes of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. And the King having taken another Doſe which performed its Operation with better ſucceſs than before, he was judged to be paſt danger, to the infinite ſatisfaction of the whole Kingdom; the rejoycings made upon this occaſion, being in all Reſpects an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Affliction cauſed by his illneſs; for, beſides that the <hi>French</hi> have naturally a moſt profound veneration for their Kings, the generality of his Subjects had conceived ſuch an extraordinary eſteem of his noble Qualities, that it is impoſſible to expreſs the Affection they bore to his Perſon.</p>
            <p>After his recovery it was judged adviſable to chuſe a Conſort; hitherto the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſome particular Reaſons would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſent to his Marriage; but the whole Court having taken the Alarm at his late ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it was reſolved on as a thing abſolutely neceſſary for the proſperity of the Realm.</p>
            <p>The Queen, who was altogether in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of her Family, had a great deſire that the King ſhould marry her Niece the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> in hopes that a good Correſpondene and firm Union might be re-eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two Crowns. The match was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>Don Antonio de Pimentel,</hi> who paſs'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95697:29"/>thro' <hi>Paris</hi> as he was going to <hi>Madrid,</hi> after his return from his Embaſſy in <hi>Sueden;</hi> but this propoſition met with much more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s ſide, than had been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen by the Queen. For the <hi>Infanta</hi> being an Heireſs, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> feared not without Reaſon, that if her Father ſhould happen to die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Male iſſue, their Monarchy would be ſwallowed up in the <hi>French,</hi> and that all thoſe Kingdoms which compoſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Empire, might, by this Marriage, in time, become Provinces of <hi>France.</hi> The reſt of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> being poſſeſs'd with the ſame fear, leſt by the Union of theſe two moſt Potent Empires, they ſhould ſcarce be able to withſtand their joynt Forces; all the other Princes, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the jealouſie of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſecretly employ'd all their Intereſt to thwart this Marriage.</p>
            <p>The Queen, to remove all Obſtables, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the King ſhould Solemnly renounce the Succeſſion to <hi>Spain,</hi> but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not ſwallow the bait, being well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was in his power to Abſolve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf whenever he thought fit, of ſo unjuſt and forced a Renunciation; beſides that it was not in his power to diſpoſe of the Inheritance of ſuch Children as ſhould be begotten betwixt them; And laſtly, conſidering that Princes generally meaſure the Juſtice of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions by the length of the Sword, they look'd upon this precaution as frivolous and of no effect. Theſe conſiderations made the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this Marriage very dubious, which hung thus in ſuſpence for two Years, till at laſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be diſcourſed at Court, that the King
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95697:29"/>was to Marry the Princeſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whoſe Picture being preſented to him, he took ſuch liking to it; that he reſolv'd to take a journey to <hi>Lyons,</hi> to ſee her in Perſon.</p>
            <p>The Queen was overjoy'd at this Journey, in hopes that her Brother would once more conſider of the matter, and when he found himſelf in danger of miſſing this opportunity, to ſhew henceforward as much inclination for the match as he had been oppoſite to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Neither did ſhe find her ſelf fruſtrated in her hopes, her wiſh being accompliſhed when ſhe expected it leaſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had during this War, which laſted four and twenty Years, ſuſtained great loſſes, they had been vanquiſhed in ſix Field Fights, and three Sea Engagements; beſides, that they had loſt above fifty places of note, and the whole Kingdom of <hi>Portugal;</hi> not to mention our Conqueſts in <hi>Germany,</hi> and thoſe of our Allies, together with the many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, in moſt of which they had been miſerably beaten. By theſe ſo terrible and frequent misfortunes, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy was reduced to ſo low an ebb, that to recover its ſtrength, it ſtood in abſolute need of a Peace; and the People of <hi>Spain</hi> being quite exhauſted, cry'd aloud for it, and in terms ſo preſſing, that the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> being cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of its former Repugnancy,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>He Marries the</hi> Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Maria Thereſia, <hi>Eldeſt Daughter, to</hi> Philip IV. <hi>King of</hi> Spain.</note> thought it moſt adviſable to ſend an Ambaſſador to offer the <hi>Infanta</hi> in Marriage to the King.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that none of theſe Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which had hitherto retarded the Marriage, were remov'd; but, it ſeems, the preſent Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency was judged more urgent than the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95697:30"/>that was to come; or perhaps, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> had raiſed theſe difficulties, only with an Intention to try, whether thereby they might obtain the better conditions of Peace. The Queen was ſo deſirous of this Match, that it was eaſie to read the ſatisfaction ſhe received by the Arrival of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentel</hi> with the Propoſitions, in her Face; the Articles were very near the ſame which had been propoſed by our Court, and every thing being thus agreed, to the mutual ſatisfaction of both Parties, it was judged convenient, that the Cardinal, and Don <hi>Lewis de Haro,</hi> the Chief Miniſters of State of both Crowns, ſhould have an interview upon the Frontiers, to put the finiſhing ſtroak to this great Work.</p>
            <p>The Treaties being ſigned on both ſides,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Interview of the</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Courts.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>French</hi> Court took a Progreſs to St. <hi>John de Luz,</hi> to meet the <hi>Infanta.</hi> The King her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had conducted her thither in Perſon, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pay the more reſpect to our King, and partly to take this opportunity to ſee the Queen his Siſter. Nothing can be imagined more magnificent than this interview. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you turn'd your Eyes,
<note place="margin">June 6, 1660.</note> there was nothing to be ſeen but the Pomp and Luſtre of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, Gold, and Silver; every one there preſent ſtriving to out-do the other in richneſs and magnificent Apparel, with this remarkable difference, however, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> appear'd far ſhort from what was to be obſerved in our Court.</p>
            <p>The Politicians, who are not ſo ſoon dazled with the outward Luſtre of Things, which are only invented to blind the Eyes of the Common People, made certain Remarks at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95697:30"/>that time, upon the appearance of theſe two Courts, from whence they drew certain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and erected the Horoſcope of both the Empires. Our King was then about one and twenty years of Age, of a vigorous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, Active, Vigilant, all his Deſigns tending to Glorious Actions, whoſe principal care was, to be always engaged in Affairs of State; his Court was compoſed of Men of the firſt Rank, not inferiour to any in <hi>Europe,</hi> either at the head of an Army, or to manage the ſecrets of the Cabinet; beſides which; there was among all theſe Princes and other Perſons of Quality not one, but what made it his chief Ambition to ſerve him to the utmoſt of his Power, and to ſacrifice his Life for the Glory of his King, and the welfare of his Country. This Noble Emulation was the happy fore-runner of all the brave Actions, performed afterwards under the Conduct of ſo great a King, the more becauſe <hi>France</hi> being a Kingdom abounding in Riches and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Things: Two Years Peace ſeem'd to be ſufficient to repair its loſſes, and to make it more flouriſhing than before.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court, there was not the ſame appearance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, but only the ſlender remainders of a State, that once, when in its Splendour, had made ſo great a noiſe in the World. Their King was advanced in Years, minding nothing ſo much as his reſt. Moſt of the Grandees had ſcarce been without the compaſs of the City of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and were ſo fond of their own Intereſts, as to look with a very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Eye upon that of the Publick. His Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95697:31"/>was exhauſted, and the Kingdom deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute both of good Troops, and expert Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; at leaſt they had very few who had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd any great Reputation abroad, ſince the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who by his Valour and Conduct, had, for ſeven or eight Years up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the tottering Fortune of that Crown, was return'd to his Duty, and came into <hi>France</hi> with all thoſe brave <hi>French</hi> Volunteers of his Party. Without calling to aid the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Stars, it was no very difficult task to foretel, in making a due compariſon betwixt theſe two Crowns, that one in all likelihood, would lay the foundation of her greatneſs upon the ruins of the other.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95697:31"/>on both ſides with the fineſt Carpets; in the Squares and Market-places were erected Triumphal Arches beautified, with Statues and Paintings, not inferiour to what the old <hi>Rome</hi> could have produced, when at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch of its Glory. Beſides this, there was an incredible number of people flock'd hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> ranged on both ſides of the Streets, upon the Scaffolds that were built for that purpoſe before the Houſes, all which together made up ſo glorious a Show, as is eaſier to be imagined than deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: All the Princes and other perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had ſpared no coſt, not only in their own Apparrel, but alſo in their Equipages and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to the higheſt degree of profuſion.</p>
            <p>The Queen appear'd in a Chariot, the King with all the Lords of his Court on Horſeback, in an Equipage ſo magnificent, that nothing was ever ſeen or heard of which bore the leaſt compariſon to this glorious Cavalcade. It was computed that the Charges beſtowed on this occaſion by particular Perſons, amounted to ten Millions of Livres, every one ſtriving to raiſe his Fortune, by giving the King the moſt ample Proofs of their Zeal for his Honour and Service. They were at a great diſtance met by the Acclamations of the People, who wiſhed the King a long and proſperous Reign. As they paſſed thro' the Streets, the Eyes of all the Spectators were fix'd upon him, ſo that it might be truly ſaid, they had no Eyes but for him; and ſcarce had he paſs'd by in one place, but the People run round about to meet him again, and to ſee him as often as poſſibly they could. Others may boaſt what

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it long before they were ſufficiently convinc'd, that they had not been unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their gueſs, when the King began to take the Reins of the Government into his own Hands, and to manage the State Affairs by his own Conduct, after the Death of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who did not ſurvive the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Peace longer than ten Months.</p>

            <head>AN <hi>ESSAY</hi> UPON THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF <hi>LEWIS</hi> the <hi>GREAT. LIB.</hi> II.</head>
            <p>BY the Death of the Cardinal Things were left in ſuch confuſion, that,
<note place="margin">The King takes the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into his own Hands.</note> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the extraordinary <hi>Idea</hi> the people had conceived of the King's great Ability, they cou'd ſcarce imagine, that a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95697:33"/>Prince then hardly two and twenty years old, would venture to take upon himſelf ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy a burthen, or if he did, it would ſcarce be poſſible for him to bear it; but they were ſoon convinc'd of their miſtake; for the King, in four or five Years time ſetled the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon ſo firm a <hi>Baſis,</hi> that for above theſe thirty Years paſt, he has govern'd the Kingdom in great Tranquility, without the aſſiſtance of a Chief Miniſter, has been Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious over his Enemies, and reſtored Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity to the Kingdom; a convincing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that a Man may ſometimes be Maſter of his own Fortune; at leaſt, thus much is certain, that Fortune will not be of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, if not upheld and managed by a dextrous Hand.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing he did was to regulate his time, and to preſcribe himſelf certain Rules and Maxims of State, gathered partly from the moſt famous Princes in former Ages, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Advice of the moſt quick-ſighted of his Council. He was ſo far from being check'd in his Glorious deſigns, by the fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that muſt needs attend the management of publick Affairs, that on the contrary, theſe ſerved only for a better reliſh of the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Pleaſures: There was never a day but he imployed five or ſix Hours with his Miniſters, who were to give him an exact account of every particular tranſaction that paſſed in the Government. He gave conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly once or twice a Week Audience to every Body, was preſent at all the Councils, and if any thing of great moment was to be debated there, he would retire into his Cloſet, to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95697:33"/>ſo long upon the matter, till he had choſen what he judged moſt adviſable to be done.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding his conſtant applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to buſineſs, it is not to be imagined,
<note place="margin">His Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements.</note> that he renounced the enjoyment of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: The heavier the burthen of publick Affairs laid upon his Shoulders, the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite it was, to be relieved by ſome pleaſant intervals. The ſtrength both of our Spirit and Body is not inexhauſtible, but limitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in certain bounds, which if tranſgreſſed, leave us deſtitute and void of Vigour. At the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign there were always Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings, Feaſtings, Balls, Carouſels, and Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Ring at Court; this young Prince taking an extraordinary delight to paſs his ſpare time in ſuch noble Exerciſes and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, as have been always accounted to belong to Princes, to dazle the Eyes of the People who are extreamly taken with theſe Things, and commonly judge of the Power of the Prince, by theſe outward appearances of Grandeur. Never any Prince underſtood better how to manage this point to his own Advantage, and how to make the Luſre of the Throne appear more Glorious in the Eyes of the People.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that his Court has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been the publick School of Politeneſs and Magnificence, notwithſtanding which, as his chief delight has been all his life time, in managing his glorious Deſigns, in order to bring them to a happy iſſue, ſo his Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were never enticeing enough to him, to make him neglect the management of Publick
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95697:34"/>Affairs: And, as young as he was, when he took the Adminiſtration of the Government into his own Hands, he ſhew'd as much Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs and Aſſiduity, in Reforming the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders that were crept into the Government, as he did for his Pleaſures. Happy Prince! who remains Maſter of his Pleaſures, who is not ſo intoxicated with his Diverſions, but that he can make uſe of, and leave them, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleaſes! He who makes himſelf a Slave to his Pleaſures, in lieu of enjoying thoſe honourable Recreations which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented for the Relaxation of our Minds and Bodies, finds himſelf inſenſibly entangl'd by a Charm ſufficient to corrupt all his generous Inclinations.</p>
            <p>Among other Abuſes that were crept into the Government,
<note place="margin">He re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes good Order in the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> the Miſ-management of the King's Revenues, as it was moſt likely to draw after it very fatal Conſequences, ſo it wanted a ſpeedy Redreſs; theſe being the Nerves of the State, which, if defective in their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the whole Body remains without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Vigour. There had been, for fifteen or ſixteen Years laſt paſt, prodigious Summs rais'd in the Kingdom; notwithſtanding which, the Government was over-charg'd with Debts, the People exhauſted with Taxes, the King's Revenues anticipated, there being but a ſlender Share left for his preſent Uſe: Beſides, that he ow'd to the Bankers above Thirty Millions of Livres.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that beſides the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Charges, there had been an abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of keeping five Armies on foot at a time; and the Civil War requir'd more than
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95697:34"/>ordinary Charges, to ſatisfie the greedineſs of the Great ones, who for the greateſt part put their Services and Intereſts to ſale to thoſe that bid moſt. This was nevertheleſs not the Principal cauſe of theſe Diſorders; the true ſource of this evil was to be look'd for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Managers and Farmers of the King's Revenues, who, keeping the reſt from the knowledge of the true value of them, Farmed them at half or a fourth part of what they were worth; beſides that, if they were to advance any Money before it was due, to ſupply the preſent Exigency of the State, they were ſure to make their own Market, at ſo dear a Rate, that it has been computed, that ſometimes out of a Million of Livres of the King's ordinary Revenue, there was not brought above two or three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand into the Exchequer.</p>
            <p>Theſe Extortions had been conſtantly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed againſt the King during his Minority, partly by the connivence of thoſe who had the management of it, and conſequently a ſhare in the Booty, partly by the preſſing neceſſity of the State, at a time, when ſtanding daily in need of the aſſiſtance of Monied Men, it was not judged ſeaſonable to dive too far into this Myſtery of iniquity, till after the Peace, when there might be ſufficient opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy theſe abuſes. But the <hi>Sur Intendant,</hi> or Overſeer-General of the King's Revenues was more mindful of his own pleaſures than this truſt. Yet was not this the only cauſe of thoſe Diſaſters which befel him afterwards; there were ſeveral other matters of complaint, of the greateſt conſequence, exhibited againſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95697:35"/>him, which deſerved ſevere Puniſhment, for he had cauſed a Seat beloning to him to be Fortified, without having demanded or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave for ſo doing; and by the profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of great Sums, made himſelf Friends, and enter'd into Cabals to avoid puniſhment. But the King being reſolv'd to ſtrike at the root of the Evil, cauſed him to be taken up and examined concerning ſuch matters as were alledged againſt him, whereof he was found guilty by his Judges. This bold ſtroke managed with ſo much Prudence, kept all the reſt in awe; the Cabal vaniſh'd inſenſibly, and notwithſtanding the vaſt ſums the <hi>Sur In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant</hi> had beſtowed among the Great ones, there was not one that durſt appear in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. A convincing inſtance, that a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy founded barely upon intereſt, is ſoon diſſolved, when the Wheel of Fortune changes, and takes away the proſpect of future Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
            <p>The King having reſtor'd Tranquility to the Kingdom, and being reſolv'd to introduce an abſolute Reformation in the Treaſury, choſe for the management of his Revenues, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well verſed in buſineſs of this nature, of an active Genius,
<note place="margin">John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouller-General of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, Chief Surveyor of the King's Buildings, and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturies.</hi>
               </note> exact in his Accounts, and a Man of an unſhaken Reſolution, to do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftice without Partiality, and immoveable to any thing that might in the leaſt turn to the diſadvantage of the State. The Perſon I ſpeak of, was <hi>John Baptiſt Colbert,</hi> afterwards Miniſter and Secretary of State, a Man of an extraordinary Head-piece, and who had ſuch an inſight into the management of publick Affairs, that he gave innumerable Proofs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95697:35"/>of his great Capacity, whilſt he ſat at the Helm.</p>
            <p>For, by the Conduct and indefatigable Care of this Miniſter, Matters ſoon appear'd with quite another Face in the King's Treaſury: The Revenues of the Crown were Let to Farm, according to their true Value, without any reſpect to Favour or Intereſt: The Salaries of the Officers were ſetled at a certain Rate: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thoſe Officers, who, during the late Troubleſome Times, had abuſed their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions; and, under the pretext of their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, pillaged the Country, and enriched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Spoils of the People, certain Commiſſioners were appointed, to manage all Affairs of moment. A Change ſo ſudden, and unexpected, appear'd like an Enchantment to the People, who were afraid that many Years could not redreſs an Evil which had taken ſo firm Root among the Courtiers; ſo that, by making due Reflections upon the Times paſt, and comparing them with the preſent State of Affairs, they fanſy'd themſelves to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into another Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The King's Treaſury was, at once, ſtor'd with Money; and a juſt Account being made of the Extorſions and Frauds committed by the Managers of the Revenue, it was found, that, inſtead of the King's being indebted to the Bankers and Receivers, they ow'd him vaſt Sums. Their prodigious Riches, and moſt magnificent Palaces, which they had built in all Parts of <hi>France;</hi> the Richneſs of their Furnitures; the Extravagancy and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs which were daily to be ſeen in their Houſes, and at their Tables; not to ſpeak of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95697:36"/>many other Things, which being ſo many Monuments of their Pride and Luxury, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd as ſo many Witneſſes againſt them, were, without queſtion, more than ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict theſe People (born, for the moſt part, to no Fortune) of Extorſions and Depredations. But the King being reſolv'd to proceed againſt them in a Legal Way,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1661.</note> a Court of Juſtice was eſtabliſhed by his Order, compoſed of certain Judges choſen out of the ſeveral <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who were to take Cognizance of all the Abuſes committed in the Management of the King's Revenues; and to puniſh the Guilty, according to the Heinouſneſs of their Crimes.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they were buſie in putting their Commiſſion in Execution, there happen'd an unforeſeen Accident, which had been likely to have proved the Source of a moſt cruel War; the Matter in queſtion being, not about the Poſſeſſion of ſome Towns or Provinces, but how to defend the moſt antient Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the <hi>French</hi> Crown, attacked by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Precedency of the</hi> French <hi>Crown.</hi>
               </note> in its moſt ſenſible Part. The fineſt Flower belonging to the <hi>French</hi> Crown, is, the Precedency it enjoys above all the others: There is no Kingdom which ſurpaſſes it in Riches, Power, and Number of People; and, in making a due Compariſon, it is evident, that the great Actions of all the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, join'd together, can ſcarce come in Competition with the glorious Exploits of the <hi>French.</hi> For theſe Thirteen Ages laſt paſt, ſince the firſt Foundation of this glorious Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, the Sceptre has never been devolved or ſurrender'd into the Hands of any Stranger:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95697:36"/>And ſuch have been the Exploits performed by the <hi>French</hi> Nation, in behalf of the True Religion, and maintaining the Liberty of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> that Time will never be able to blot out the Memory of ſuch glorious Actions, nor the Praiſe and Acknowledgment due to ſuch important Services. Who knows, but that all <hi>Europe</hi> might, at this Day, have groaned under the Yoke of the <hi>Califfs</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> if the Bravery of the <hi>French</hi> had not ſet Bounds to their Conquering Arms, and put a Stop to the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who, like a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Torrent, were over-running the beſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> when <hi>Charles Martel</hi> put them to an entire Rout.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> has, at all Times, been the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Place of Refuge for diſtreſſed Princes; but eſpecially for the Popes, who are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the Liberality of <hi>Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> for all thoſe vaſt Poſſeſſions, of which they are Sovereigns, in <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  <hi>He had been everal imes Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of</hi> St. Sebaſtian.</note> eaſily imagining that this Bravado was not an Invention of his own, as being a Man of better Underſtanding, and too well vers'd in Affairs of this nature, than to ſignalize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without expreſs Orders from Court, by a Zeal ſo indiſcreet, as muſt needs expoſe the King, his Maſter, to this Nonplus, either to take a groſs Affront, in diſowning what his Miniſter had done, and to declare him to have been in the wrong, to conteſt with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, for the Precedency; or elſe, to ſee himſelf again entangl'd in a War, which, in all likelihood, muſt prove fatal to him, at a Time, when he knew himſelf to be in a worſe Condition than ever to ſuſtain it. On the other hand, the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Health,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95697:38"/>as well as the preſent State of the Kingdom, being in a declining Condition, exhauſted of Money, and deſtitute of good Forces, there ſeem'd to be no likelihood, that <hi>Spain,</hi> after the late concluſion of a Peace, ſo much deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their ſide, and ſo dearly bought, ſhould be ſo forward to break it, on the account of a punctilio of Precedency; eſpecially, ſince hitherto,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>By Policy in</hi> Poland, 1573. <hi>By threats at</hi> Rome, 1564.</note> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had rather been enclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſurprize the <hi>French</hi> in this point, by ſome State-trick or other, or to try whether they could hector them out of their Right by threats; but never were come to ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, even when engaged with one another in War, and when that Monarchy was arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the higheſt pitch of its greatneſs.</p>
            <p>But howſoever it be, this ſeem'd to be the laſt effort the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intended to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their pretended Precedency; This En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe of the Count of <hi>Batteville</hi> having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſufficient opportunity for all the World to be convinc'd, that as this undertaking of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſavour'd very much of Vanity, ſo the <hi>French</hi> had all the reaſon in the World on their ſide to maintain a juſt prerogative they enjoy'd for ſo many Ages.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> had no ſooner received Intelligence of what had happened upon this occaſion in <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">George de Aubuſſon <hi>Archbiſhop of</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun, <hi>and Biſhop of</hi> Metz.</note> but he ſent immediate Orders to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Ambrun,</hi> then his Ambaſſador in <hi>Madrid,</hi> to demand ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for what was paſt, and in caſe of refuſal, to leave that Court and to return into <hi>France.</hi> It is a cuſtomary thing with the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> to conclude upon nothing, even of the leaſt moment, without many tergiverſations
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95697:39"/>and delays; whether it it be, that they look upon it as a Maxim of State, whereby to tire out thoſe that make their Applications to them, and conſequently to make them more pliable; or whether it be only a Cuſtom, proceeding more from their Natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than any Myſtery of State, I will not pretend to determine: Thus much is certain, that as ſoon as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ambrun</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſatisfaction in the King his Maſter's Name, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> promiſed to make due reparation to the King of <hi>France,</hi> his Son-in-Law, and that he would recall the Count <hi>de Batteville,</hi> his Ambaſſador, out of <hi>England.</hi> This was a fair ſtep towards the demanded ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, but not altogether ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the affront given upon ſo extraordinary an occaſion; the Chaſtiſement intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, might give ſome ſatisfaction for what was paſſed, but did not remove the main Obſtacle; it being more than probable that the ſame quarrel might be ſoon revived, if the <hi>Catholick</hi> King perſiſted in his Pretenſions concerning the Precedency.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the other Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> did underhand edge on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court not to part with their pretended Prerogative, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natural for Princes to be jealous of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in ſo nice a point as this, which the <hi>French</hi> Kings had enjoyed time out of mind; or, becauſe they were not without apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that, if a King ſo Young, Valiant, and Potent, ſhould gain a point of ſo vaſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence without oppoſition, it might in all likelihood be a ſufficient encouragement for him, to make farther Encroachments upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95697:39"/>Princes bordering upon <hi>France.</hi> It was for this reaſon that two or three Months were elapſed, before the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> would take a final reſolution in the matter, there being not a few of them, who were of opinion, rather to hazard all, than to part with this Prerogative. But the difficulty was, by what means it was to be maintained againſt the King, without expoſing the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> to utter deſtruction, ſo that at laſt it was found expedient for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to engage his Word, that the Marquis <hi>de la Fuenta,</hi> nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to go Ambaſſadour from that Court to <hi>France,</hi> ſhould, in his firſt Audience, give ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſatisfaction to his moſt Chriſtian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, both in reſpect of what was paſſed, and for the time to come.</p>
            <p>To add to the Solemnity of this Audience,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The King of</hi> Spain <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces the Precedency,</hi> March 24, 1662.</note> and to have a conſiderable number of Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Witneſſes preſent, who might teſtifie to the World, what they had heard the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour ſay upon this occaſion, the King had invited all the Foreign Miniſters, who all appeared, to the number of thirty; they were placed on the right ſide of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Throne, as were on the left the Princes of the Blood, the Miniſters of State, and other Officers of the Court. In the preſence of this Auguſt and Noble Aſſembly, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour told the King, <hi>That the King of</hi> Spain <hi>his Maſter, had been extreamly diſſatisfied at what had happened in</hi> London <hi>on the</hi> 10th <hi>of</hi> October, 1661. <hi>That ſo ſoon as he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it he recall'd the Baron</hi> de Batteville, <hi>with expreſs Orders to return forthwith into</hi> Spain, <hi>where he intended to give him ſuch ſevere Proofs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95697:40"/>of his diſpleaſure, as ſo extravagant an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking did deſerve: That he had ſent Orders to all his Ambaſſadors abroad, not to appear in any publick Ceremonies, where there might be the leaſt likelihood of conteſt on the account of this Precedency, and not to ſtand in competition for the future upon that ſcore, with the Ambaſſadours and other Miniſters of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The four <hi>French</hi> Secretaries of State there preſent, ordered an Inſtrument in Writing to be drawn up, containing the ſame Words of this Declaration, to ſerve in time to come, as a laſting Monument to Poſterity, of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſucceſs of ſo memorable a Tranſaction, which, for ſome time, had kept all <hi>Europe</hi> in ſuſpenſe, and for theſe hundred Years laſt paſt had made ſo much noiſe in the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two moſt Potent Houſes of <hi>Europe,</hi> who being like the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of all the reſt, put an end to that famous Conteſt, which a moſt glorious Emulation had raiſed betwixt them.</p>
            <p>Scarce was this difference compoſed,
<note place="margin">Auguſt 20, 1662.</note> but there aroſe another betwixt the Pope and the King, occaſioned by an Aſſault made upon the Duke <hi>de Croqui,</hi> his Majeſty's Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour at the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Affront put upon the Ambaſſadour was ſo groſs, that the like has ſcarce ever been heard of among civiliz'd Nations, but it muſt alſo be confeſs'd, that the Hiſtory of all former Ages ſcarce can furniſh us with an Example, where the Law of Nations has been more gloriouſly vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated than upon this occaſion, and where thoſe who had impudence enough to violate it, have been more ſeverely chaſtiſed.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:95697:40"/>
            <p>Two or three unknown Perſons being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by ten Souldiers of the Pope's Guard,
<note place="margin">Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der VII.</note> had ſought for ſhelter in the Stables belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Palace of <hi>Farneſe</hi> where the ſaid <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour reſided at that time. Some of his Domeſticks being come out at the noiſe and claſhing of the Swords, had driven the Souldiers back, who being reinforced with ſome of their Comerades, in their turn beat the Ambaſſadour's Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, whom they purſued, and forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat within the very Gates of the Palace-The Duke, in the mean while was come home thro' another Gate, having underſtood the occaſion of the tumult, ordered his Servants immediately to deſiſt, and to withdraw within the Palace. This precaution, which he ſuppoſed might be a fit means to appeaſe the Inſolence of the Soldiers, ſerved only to augment it; for, in a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſaw them marching with Drums beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their Officers at the head of them towards the Palace, which they inveſted on all ſides, putting <hi>Corps de Guards</hi> on all the Avenues leading to it; and not contented with this, they committed other moſt enormous outrages, diſcharging their Fuſees charg'd with Ball, for an Hour together, at the Gates and Windows of the Palace, not ſparing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Ambaſſadour's Perſon, who came out into a Balcony, to ſee what paſſed among them. He was no ſooner oblig'd to retire from thence, but they attack'd the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drice, who being ignorant of what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed near her Palace, was returning home in her Coach. She was in no ſmall danger of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95697:41"/>having been aſſaſſinated by ſeveral Muſquet Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets that paſſed near her, but ſhe had the good Fortune to eſcape without any other hurt than what was occaſioned by the fright; one of her Pages being kill'd juſt by her Coach ſide, and one of the Footmen ſorely woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. At the ſame time the <hi>Shirri's,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make uſe of Fire-Armes, followed cloſely the Footſteeps of the Soldiers, knocking down all the <hi>French</hi> Men they met with in the Streets of <hi>Rome;</hi> and in all likelihood this Tragedy would have ended in a General Maſſacre of the <hi>French,</hi> if the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had not te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified their averſion to ſuch barbarous Actions, and made loud exclamations againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as well as the Executioners of this bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Tragedy.</p>
            <p>If the Government had not been concerned in this Action of the Souldiery, it had been but a piece both of Juſtice and Prudence to have given ſome publick and real Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their diſlike, by inflicting a prompt and moſt rigorous puniſhment upon theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Offenders; but ſo far were they from calling them to a ſevere acceunt, that they gave opportunity to the Ring-leaders, and ſuch others as were known to have been moſt concerned in the ſlaughter of the <hi>French,</hi> to ſlip away, eight or nine days being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before they made an enquiry after thoſe Aſſaſſins. To heap injuries upon injuries, the <hi>Cardinal Imperiale,</hi> Governour of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome time after block'd up a freſh the Palace of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> under pretext, that it had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, that the Ambaſſadour, ever ſince the laſt affront was offer'd, did appear abroad
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95697:41"/>with a more numorous Attendance than he had been uſed to do before; ſo that the Duke ſeeing himſelf treated with ſo much Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, left <hi>Rome,</hi> and retired to a place belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The News of a thing ſo exterordinary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communicated to moſt Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> there were very few who could perſwade themſelves, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> could be ſo much overſeen, as to come to thoſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, without great provocation given on the Ambaſſadour's ſide. But all what could be laid to his Charge, amounted to no more, than that he had delay'd for ſome days to pay the firſt Viſit to ſome of the Pope's Kindred, who were not of the Eccleſiaſtical Order, the Duke being willing to receive firſt the King's Inſtructions, concerning a Punctilio which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto remained undecided. For the reſt, they pretended to have great cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt the Duke, who, as they alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, peing of a haughty temper, had diſſuaded the King from allowing yearly penſions to theſe new Princes: And this being que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs the main cauſe of their hatred, was alſo the true occaſion of the quarrel; for, it was eaſie to be perceived, that upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, they ſhow'd much Indifferency not only to the Ambaſſadour, but alſo to the <hi>French</hi> Nation in general, which at laſt broke out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an open Enmity. For conſiderable time there had ſcarce paſs'd a day, but ſome ſparks of that devouring Fire, which lay couch'd under the Aſhes, did appear, which at laſt, broke out in a Flame, with the more noiſe and violence. The Offence, (if any had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95697:42"/>been given) was ſcarce worth taking notice of; but ſuppoſing it had been much greater, the Revenge appear'd ſo Cruel in the Eyes of all the World, that notwithſtanding all the endeavours uſed by the Pope to engage the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> in the quarrel, neither that King, nor any other Prince, ſhew'd the leaſt Inclination to eſpouſe it, unleſs it were to diſpoſe the Pope to give abſolute ſatisfaction to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spain</hi> had indeed no reaſon to aſſiſt the Pope's Kindred, it was rather for the Intereſt of that Crown to clip a little their Wings, and to make them ſhew more reſpect to their more Potent Neighbours; beſides, it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them very nearly, to avoid all occaſions of drawing the <hi>French</hi> Arms into <hi>Italy.</hi> Another advantage which that Crown propoſed to its ſelf, by abandoning the Pope's Intereſt at this time, and conſequently to put him under a neceſſity of giving due ſatisfaction to the King, was, that they did not queſtion thereby to kindle an irreconcilable hatred betwixt them, which being continued in the Family of the <hi>Chigi's,</hi> would, in all probability prove as miſchievous to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, as it would be profitable to them in the next <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave.</hi> It is true, they could not but look with a jealous Eye upon the Glory which the King was likely to reap from the ſaid ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but conſidering on the other Hand, that this augmentation of his Power would alſo ſerve for fuel to kindle jealouſie in the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Europe;</hi> the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> judged it moſt for their Intereſt to ſtand Neuter, and to endeavour, by all means, to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95697:42"/>perſwade the Pope to put an end to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, without coming to an open rupture.</p>
            <p>But Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII was Deaf to their Counſels. Before his Elevation to the Papal Dignity he had led a very Auſtere Life, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the leaſt inclination for his Kindred, or any other Worldly Pleaſures, for which reaſon he uſed always to have a Coffin ſet in his Bed-Chamber, to put him in mind of Mortality; but being by his Elevation arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the higheſt pitch of his hopes, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd quite different from what he had been before; he affected an extraordinary magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of his Apparrel, his Furnitures and Equipages were very ſumptuous, no body more nice and delicate in his Table than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and he ſhew'd ſo much tenderneſs for his Kindred, that he heap'd upon them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Riches. So true it is, that when thoſe who have led an Auſtere Life, are once made ſenſible of the Pleaſures and Vanities of the World, they are ſure to make themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for what they have loſt before.</p>
            <p>The falſe <hi>Idea</hi> the Pope had conceived of his own Power and Strength, the ſtrong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination he had for his Family, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy he bore to <hi>France,</hi> made him reſolve at laſt, either to refuſe the demanded ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>France,</hi> or at leaſt, to put it off by various delays, as long as poſſible could be done, in hopes that by ſome favourable jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture or other, the Face of Affairs might be changed in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is unqueſtionable, that the King had all the reaſon in the World to be diſſatisfied with the Pope, and that he did not want means to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95697:43"/>do himſelf juſtice for the injuries received at his Hands; but being willing to ſhew a more than Filial reſpect to the Holy See, he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended his juſt reſentment for a whole twelve Month. For, if on one ſide, the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo groſs an affront provok'd him to Revenge; on the other Hand, the miſeries and inconveniencies which attend a War to be waged in a far diſtant Country, againſt the common Father of the Faithful, kept his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in ſuſpence. It is not to be denied, but that without reproach to himſelf, he could ſcarce delay his Vengeance, eſpecially, ſince it might be done without the leaſt danger to his Affairs; but it was alſo to be conſider'd that as the danger was inconſiderable, ſo there was but little Honour to be gotten by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. But being at laſt fuly convinc'd, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> took advantage from theſe delays to abuſe his patience, he order'd his Troops to march to wards <hi>Italy,</hi> and having ſeized uyon <hi>Avignon,</hi> every thing was put in a readineſs to paſs the <hi>Alps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was then that the Pope thought it high time to open his Eyes, and that it was for his Intereſt to make a Virtue of Neceſſity, and to prefer an Inglorious Peace, before a War, which, in all human appearance, muſt prove very ſucceſsful to him. His Kindred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves perſwaded him to take the ſureſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as judging it more for their Intreſt, to turn the Mony raiſed by the Pope for the uſe of the War, their own uſe, than to render themſelves Obnoxious, by making themſelves inſtrumental in troubling the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to betray their Vanity to the World, in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95697:43"/>being ſo preſumptuous, as to meaſure their Power with the greateſt King of Chriſtendom. A Treaty therefore being agreed upon to be ſet on Foot at <hi>Piſa,</hi> (the King refuſing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>Rome</hi> for the place of Treaty) it was concluded ſoon after, upon the following Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
            <p>That the Pope ſhould be obliged to ſend the <hi>Cardinal Patroon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Chigi.</note> in Quality of his <hi>Legat</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to diſown the whole Action of the <hi>Corſick</hi> Guards.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Legat</hi> himſelf ſhould make his Proteſtation before the King, that neither he,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Pope ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the Affrone put upon the</hi> French <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</hi>
               </note> nor any of his Family had had the leaſt Hand, in that attempt, and that for the time to come, they would be ready to give ample demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of their Real Submiſſion, and Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the King.</p>
            <p>That his Holineſs's Brother ſhould be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make the ſame proteſtation in Writing, and to leave <hi>Rome,</hi> till ſuch time that the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat</hi> had given the promiſed ſatisfaction to the King.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Cardinal Imperiale</hi> ſhould likewiſe come in Perſon into <hi>France,</hi> to juſtifie himſelf, and to ſubmit his Cauſe, if required, to the deciſion of the King.</p>
            <p>That the whole <hi>Corſick</hi> Nation ſhould for the future be declar'd incapable of ſerving in the Eccleſiaſtical State; and to brand with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Infamy an Action ſo Inſolent, a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid ſhould be erected, juſt oppoſite to the <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> in which ſhould be Engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the reaſon of their Baniſhment.</p>
            <p>By Virtue of the ſame Treaty, the Dukes of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Modena,</hi> beſides ſeveral other
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95697:44"/>
               <hi>Roman</hi> Lords that were in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, obtained conſiderable advantages, all which was to be attributed to the protection of the moſt Potent King in Chriſtendom, who thus obliged the Pope to give him the moſt ample ſatisfaction that could be for the Affront put upon his Miniſter.</p>
            <p>The Treaty was executed accordingly:
<note place="margin">July 3, 1664.</note> The <hi>Legat</hi> came into <hi>France;</hi> the Pyramid was Erected, and remained ſtanding for five Years after;
<note place="margin">1667.</note> when by the interceſſion of <hi>Clement</hi> IX, the Succeſſor of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII, the King was graciouſly pleaſed to order it to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down.</p>
            <p>What could be more glorious at the very beginning of our King's Reign, than to come off Triumphantly upon two ſo extraordinary occaſions, without as much as drawing a Sword? Theſe were the marvellous effects of the King's growing Reputation, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing more and more every day, had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a new Luſtre, the Year before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Treaty of <hi>Piſa,</hi> by the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> which was bought with much leſs charge than in all probability it could have been taken.</p>
            <p>After the taking of this place, we were, by Virtue of a Treaty concluded with <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> obliged to ſurrender it into his Hands. It was a very unfortunate thing for us, to be forced to deliver the Key of our Kingdom into the Hands of ſuch Strangers, as we were ſenſible would not fail to lay hold of all opportunities to trouble our repoſe. The King being ſenſible of this inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, had no ſooner taken the Reins of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95697:44"/>into his own Hands, but he only watch'd for a favourable juncture, to ſend theſe dangerous Neighbours back to their Iſland, and to incorporate the ſaid place with the reſt of his Conqueſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> II. King of <hi>England,</hi> being lately re-eſtabliſhed in his Throne, this juncture ſeem'd to be the moſt favourable in the World, to treat with him about the Surrender of this place, at a time, when we were ſenſible that he was not in a condition to be at the charge of maintaining a Fleet in the Port of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> or to provide the City with ſuch a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, as might be ſufficient to make a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous defence, in caſe of an Attack.

<note place="margin">Dunkirk <hi>bought from the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</note> It was looked upon as one of the moſt refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pieces of Policy in the <hi>French,</hi> to have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged that grand Affair with ſo much dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as to make themſelves Maſters of a place of that importance, at the price of four Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Livres, in ſpite of all the oppoſition of their jealous Neighbours. The King had no ſooner received the News that his Forces had taken poſſeſſion of it, but he went thither to give the neceſſary Orders for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing the Fortifications of a place, which was of the higheſt conſequence for the ſafety of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeveral Affairs of the higheſt moment, tho' they took up much of the King's time, who ſpared no labour nor care, till they were brought to a happy iſſue; yet did this not ſo confine his Active Genius, but that at the ſame time he applied his thoughts towards the re-eſtabliſhment of the decay'd Military Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, and to find out ſuitable remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe abuſes that were, by degrees, crept into the Government.

            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:95697:45"/>
            <p>As he was ſufficiently accquainted with the Natural Inclinations of Mankind, to know that the moſt Valiant Men in the World, if not confin'd under certain Rules and Diſcipline, muſt be more hurtful than profitable to the State, ſo he took a firm reſolution to re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh among them ſuch Laws, as founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Prudent ſeverity, ſhould be ſufficient to keep them within their due bounds. As he took effectual care that his Souldiers, whether in ſickneſs or health, ſhould be provided with all things neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence, ſo he would not allow any one to be exempted from the exact obſervation of theſe Rules; and all the Employments in the Army from the higheſt to the loweſt, being beſtowed upon ſuch as had deſerved well, in proportion to their Merits, there was a ſtrange alteration to be obſerved in the Army. For, the deſire of Glory, the Honour to pleaſe the King, the fear of Puniſhment, and the hopes of Reward; this happy mixture, I ſay, of ſeveral Intereſts and Paſſions, made ſuch powerful impreſſions upon the minds of the Souldiery, that every one in his Station, ſtrove as much to out-do the other, in the juſt obſervance of his Duty, as they formerly had been eager after Rapines, and negligent in performing their Military Functions. Thus a good Order being re-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in the Army, it may be ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out boaſting, that poſſibly, there ſcarce ever appear'd better diſciplin'd Troops in the Field, than the <hi>French</hi> Armies under the Reign of the preſent King.</p>
            <p>After the concluſion of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Peace, the greateſt part of the <hi>French</hi> Forces were
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95697:46"/>disbanded; nevertheleſs, as thoſe that were kept in pay, were all choſen Men, ſo the King took care to augment them from time to time, not only to ſerve in his Garriſons, but alſo to have in readineſs ſuch a number of well Diſciplin'd Troops, as he judg'd ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to maintain his reſpect, both among his Subjects and Neighbours. For, what real aſſurance can a Prince have of the Fidelity of the one, and of the ſincerity of the others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be in a condition to maintain his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by his Power?</p>
            <p>The better to train up his Soldiers to the Wars, he order'd every Year Encampments to be made in ſome place or other, where they perform'd all the Exerciſes belonging ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Sieges or Battles, without Blood-ſhed. This was look'd upon as of ſo much conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that even in the moſt peaceable times it was never diſcontinued, afterthey had once been convinced of its uſefulneſs; it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on all Hands, that not any thing elſe contributed ſo much to the inuring the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery to the Fatigues of Wars, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to the obtaining ſo many Victories in the following Years, as theſe Engagements, Reviews, and Exerciſes, which kept the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under a conſtant good Diſcipline, and trained up the young Officers as well as the Soldiers, to ſerve their Apprenticeſhip at home in the Action of War.</p>

The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> notwithſtanding they much flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd themſelves with the Honour they believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have gain'd againſt their Enemies, yet were very deſirous of Peace, theſe Demi-tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, and the loſs of ſo many brave Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being but a ſlender recompence for the damage they receiv'd in the interruption of their Commerce. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> irritated more by ſhame than the conſideration of their loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, left no Stone unturn'd to break this Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and to draw our King from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Intereſt; but in vain, for the King proteſting he would not abandon his Allies, a Peace was ſoon after concluded at <hi>Breda,</hi>
               <note place="margin">July 31, 1667.</note> which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantageous to the States.</p>
            <p>About two Months before the concluſion of this Treaty, the King was enter'd <hi>Flanders</hi> with a conſiderable Force, to do himſelf Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice on the juſt Pretenſions of the Queen: Her right was ſo unqueſtionable on the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Brabant</hi> and its Dependencies, upon part of <hi>Gueldres,</hi> upon <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> the <hi>Franchè Comtè, Mons, Antwerp, Cambray, Malines, Limbourg, Namur,</hi> and ſome other places on the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> that the King having taken the Advice of the moſt Famous Lawyers of the Low-Countries, upon the point in queſtion, under borrow'd Names, they were unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly of opinion, that her Right was indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95697:51"/>According to the Cuſtom of theſe. Provinces, it is an Eſtabliſh'd Law, that the Children begotten in the firſt Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Heirs to the Poſſeſſions of their Parents, immediately after the Deceaſe of one of them. the Survivor enjoying only the benefit of them during Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> IV. King of <hi>Spain</hi> had by <hi>Iſabella</hi> his firſt Spouſe, only two Children, to wit,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prince</hi> Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaſar.</note> one Son, and one Daughter, ſince Queen of <hi>France,</hi> who ſurviving the Prince, theſe Provinces by right of Succeſſion, purſuant to the Cuſtom of the Country, which regulates as well the right of Succeſſion in reſpect to Soveraigns, as private Perſons, were devolved to her.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that, at the time of her Marriage, they had taken this precaution, to make her renounce all her Rights and Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to thoſe Provinces; but beſides, the Act it ſelf was ſo defective in Form, and full of Nullities, that according to the judgment of the moſt underſtanding and unbyaſs'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it could not paſs for a Legal Act.</p>
            <p>She renounces all her Rights and Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, without naming any in particular. She therefore reſgn'd that which ſhe knew not, and what ſhe had not had the opportunity to examine, of what moment it was ſhe was going to do, and this when ſhe was under Age, rather out of a Motive of Obedience, than free Choice. And to this the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Father and King, the want of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Knowledge of her own Intereſt, the Paſſion ſhe had for the King's Perſon, and the proſpect of having for her Spouſe, one of the handſomeſt and greateſt Princes of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:95697:52"/>All theſe, if taken together, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it, if the <hi>Infanta</hi> had not conſtancy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to refuſe the Requeſt of the King her Father, and blindly to follow his Dictates.</p>
            <p>Thus they had made her renounce to the Succeſſion of the Empire of the <hi>Indies,</hi> of the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Naples, Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Majorca,</hi> to the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Sovereignty of nine Provinces in the Low Countries; I ſay to the hopes, foraſmuch as her Brother was alive, but ſo infirm, that it was ſuppoſed he could not live very long.</p>
            <p>Another conſideration,
<note place="margin">Charles <hi>II. King of</hi> Spain.</note> which is of no ſlight moment, is, that this Renunciation was made without allowing her any other equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Golden Crown</hi> 8 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. Sterl.</hi>
               </note> except five hundred thouſand Golden Crown pieces, which indeed, was owing to her before on the account of her Mothers Dowry. Could any thing be more injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived than this? Another thing that makes this void and of no effect is, that this Equivalent (ſuppoſing it ſhould be term'd ſo) was never paid to her, neither in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's life time, nor after his Death; nay, there was no tender made of it within the time limited in the Act; without which, it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, that the Queen did not make this Renunciation, but in conſideration of the ſaid ſumm, to be paid at the terms, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Contract. Who is ſo ignorant as not to underſtand, that in all conditional Contracts their validity depends on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the Conditions therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:95697:52"/>
            <p>Another Capital defect in this Act is, that it was not corroborated by theſe circumſtances, which in a caſe of that moment, are preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Laws. As the order of Succeſſion ought to be conſidered as one of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws of an Empire or Kingdom, ſo the ſame is unalterable, unleſs by conſent of the People Aſſembled for that purpoſe. The Queen being, after her Brother's Death, the unqueſtionable and immediate Heireſs to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> his moſt Catholick Majeſty, when he intended to deprive and exclude this Princeſs of her Legal Inheritance, ought to have call'd together an Aſſembly of all the States of the whole Kingdom, and the Queen in their Preſence ought to have made a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Renunciation, both for her ſelf and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to the Succeſſion of all theſe Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; after which, the ſaid Renunciation muſt have been Publiſhed throughout all the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories under the Juriſdiction of <hi>Spain.</hi> But it being certain, that not the leaſt of all theſe circumſtances had been obſerved in this Act, it cannot be conſidered as a Legal Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, but as ſurreptitious and forced upon the Queen without her knowledge. It ought to be look'd upon as a meer State-trick and contrivance of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to ſerve their own turn and ambitious deſigns, which being contrary to all Laws, could not in the leaſt impair the Legal Right of the Queen, or of the Prince her Son.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the King had thus all the reaſon in the World, neither wanted ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power to oblige the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to a full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, he nevertheleſs offer'd to come
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95697:53"/>with them to a Compoſition. The Queen-Mother made uſe of all her Intereſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> either to give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the King upon his demands, or elſe to accept of the King's Gracious offer, to take an Equivalent, and to releaſe part of his Right, provided they would put him in quiet poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the reſt.
<note place="margin">

She was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally lamented by the whole Kingdom, and that not without great reaſon; <hi>France</hi> having not for many Years before been bleſſed with a Queen more deſerving than her ſelf. She was of a very noble aſpect, but endowed with a much more noble Soul, a Soul truly great; and elevated above the common rank, Pious, Obliging, and Honourable, whoſe greateſt pleaſure was to doe good, and who by her charming converſation, drew both Love and Reſpect from all who had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to know her.</p>
            <p>After the Deceaſe of the Queen, our King renewed his former demands at the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and as the caſe then ſtood with <hi>Spain,</hi> there were very few, who balancing their Forces with ours at that time, were not of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that, if it ſhould come to a rupture, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might think themſelves happy, if they could come off with the loſs of what they were ſo much afraid to loſe. For their Troops in <hi>Flanders</hi> were in a very ill condition, their Fortifications had been neglected, and were neither provided with Ammunition, nor a ſufficient number of good Troops. The Council of <hi>Spain</hi> could not be ignorant of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95697:53"/>all this, but whether it were that they rely'd upon the aſſiſtance of their Allies, or that they did not rightly meaſure the King's ſtrength and reſolution, certain it is, that he could never obtain any ſatisfaction as to his juſt Right, no not as much as a promiſe of ever obtaining any upon that ſcore; ſo that after a fruitleſs Treaty of eighteen or twenty Months,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The King enters</hi> Flanders, 1667.</note> our King was obliged to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Arms. He marched therefore in Perſon, at the head of an Army of thirty five thouſand Men, commanded under him by the Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> into <hi>Flanders.</hi> At the ſame time he ordered two Flying Camps, the one to enter the County of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of <hi>Francis de Crequy,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of <hi>France,</hi> to obſerve the motions of the <hi>Germans</hi> on that ſide; the other to take its march along the Sea Coaſt, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Anthony d' Aumont</hi> Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> who took <hi>Courtray</hi> in two days, <hi>Dyxmuiden</hi> in four and twenty Hours; <hi>Furnes</hi> in one Day; and <hi>Armentiers</hi> ſurrender'd as ſoon as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd before it. The Army which the King commanded in Perſon, found as little reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as the other, <hi>Charleroy</hi> was demoliſhed by the <hi>Spaniards; Binch</hi> and <hi>Aeth</hi> opened their Gates at the ſame moment they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſight of them; <hi>Tournay</hi> did not hold out above twice four and twenty Hours, and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vay</hi> and its Citadel no longer; <hi>Oudenarde</hi> not above one Day, and <hi>Aloſt</hi> but a few Hours: To be ſhort, in leſs than four Months time they made themſelves Maſters of thirteen or fourteen places, all very conſiderable for their ſtrength.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:95697:54"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Liſle</hi> alone held out a Siege of eleven days, after opening of the Trenches. It is a large City, very well Fortified, and accounted the moſt Populous of any in the <hi>Spaniſh Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</hi> There were at that time within the City, no leſs than thirty thouſand Inhabitants capable of bearing Arms, beſides four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Soldiers, and a great number of good Officers and Volunteers, who had thrown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Place, to ſignalize themſelves upon this occaſion, under one of the beſt and moſt experienc'd Commanders in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service. The King having received Advice that the Count <hi>de Marcin</hi> General of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Army, was on his march to relieve the Place, he detach'd the Marſhal <hi>de Crequi</hi> (who had joyn'd him before with his Flying Camp) to poſſeſs himſelf of all the Avenues, thro' which the Count <hi>de Marcin</hi> muſt needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the place. The City being in the mean while forced to Capitulate, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to march ſtreight to the Enemy; But the Marſhal <hi>de Crequi</hi> on one, and <hi>Bernard de Gigant de Bellefons,</hi> likewiſe Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> on the other ſide, had ſaved the King this trouble; they having before routed the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> of whom they killed five hundred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpot, took from them ſeveral Standards and Kettle-Drums, and three hundred Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, among whom were many Colonels, and ſome of their General Officers. Count <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin,</hi> who was not inſenſible that the whole fortune of <hi>Flanders</hi> depended on his Army, thought it moſt adviſable to make a ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and to throw his Troops into ſuch places, as were moſt expoſed to the Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enemy.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:95697:54"/>
            <p>This prodigious progreſs of the King's Arms, did alarm all the Neighbouring Princes, who did not without great reaſon fear, that the next Campaign, he would like a torrent, over-run all the reſt of the <hi>Spaniſh Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</hi> There had for many Years laſt paſt, been an implacable hatred between the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> but, as Love and Hatred among Sovereigns are ſwayed by Intereſt, theſe two Nations ſetting aſide all former Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, were ſoon reconciled, when the laſt being terrified by the late ſucceſs of our Arms, found their own ſecurity to depend on the preſervation of the firſt; to ſtop the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the King's Conqueſts, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Flanders</hi> from falling into his Hands, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> enter'd into a League with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Sueden,</hi> by virtue of which,
<note place="margin">Jan. 23. 1668.</note> theſe three engaged themſelves to furniſh each of them fifteen thouſand Men (beſides their <hi>quota</hi> at Sea) for the defence of <hi>Flanders:</hi> This League was called the <hi>Tripple Alliance.</hi> But, as their chief aim was rather to terrifie both Parties into a compliance, than to enter into an open War, they offer'd their Mediation with this Solemn Declaration, that they were ready to take up Arms, againſt either of theſe two Crowns, which they ſhould find averſe to the Peace.</p>
            <p>The King, tho' in the midſt of the Career of his Victories, yet was not unwilling to hearken to their Propoſitions; and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, what he had taken from the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> did fall far ſhort from what his juſt Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were on the Queen's account, yet he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to reſt contented with his Conqueſts.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:95697:55"/>
            <p>A Treaty was therefore agreed on to be ſet on Foot at <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> to compoſe theſe differences; But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadours on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavouring to gain time by delays, the King, to oblige them to a more ready com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, and not to let ſlip any opportunity of purſuing his Right,

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Froſts nor Snow, neither the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of the Rivers, nor badneſs of the Ways, were able to ſtay him at home, nor to prevent his march, but with an eagerneſs ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the greatneſs of his deſign, he appear'd at the Head of his Army, with ſuch ſucceſs, that the whole Province ſubmitted within the ſpace of eight days, A Conqueſt ſo ſudden did not only ſurprize the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but alſo the Mediators, to that degree, that without any further tergiverſations, they offer'd to grant the King's former demands, provided he would reſtore the <hi>Franche Compte.</hi> The King was unwilling to part with ſo fair a Province, extreamly convenient for its ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; but the Love of Peace prevailing over his Intereſt, he reſolv'd rather to abandon that Province, than to continue the War, at a time when the Allies being more powerful at Sea than the <hi>French,</hi> might, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, have made an attempt upon our Coaſts, or at leaſt have ruin'd our Trade at Sea; A Peace was therefore concluded at <hi>Aix la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle,</hi> on the Second of <hi>May,</hi> in the Year 1668. by Virtue of which, our King reſtor'd to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the <hi>Franche Compte,</hi> all their Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions demoliſh'd; and theſe reſign'd to the King all the places they had Conquer'd in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with their dependencies.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:95697:55"/>
            <p>This Peace was ſoon follow'd by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of an union in the Church,
<note place="margin">Janſeniſm <hi>ſuppreſs'd in</hi> France.</note> which for theſe fifteen or twenty Years laſt paſt, had been interrupted by ſome diſputes about the true nature of <hi>Grace,</hi> and were riſen to that pitch, as to threaten the Church and State with great Commotions, if by the prudent Care of the King the Tempeſt had not been laid, and a perfect Calm introduc'd. The moſt ſurpriſing thing in the World! That Religion which ſhould be the ſtricteſt tye of Charity among Men, proves two frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſcource of Conteſts and Diviſions. What is more frequent, than to ſee Mankind follow blindfold the opinion of their Leaders with ſo much Zeal, as to involve the State in a Civil War; a Prince therefore, who truly underſtands his Intereſt, can never be too watchful to keep a ſtrict Hand over thoſe who ſow the firſt Seeds of theſe Diſcords, and when he has nipp'd them in the bud, to take effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al care to prevent them from growing again, and taking root among his Subjects.</p>
            <p>As it is beyond queſtion, that Mankind are not capable of performing any good Works meriting Eternal Salvation without God's <hi>Grace,</hi> ſo it is very difficult to determine in what manner this <hi>Grace</hi> operates in us: This is one of thoſe Myſtery's which are not to be attempted without great hazard, the ſcrutiny proving frequently dangerous to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, who flatters himſelf to exhauſt their meaning, rather by ſubtilities than a plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, Into what groſs errors are we not apt to fall, when flattering our ſelves to be more quick-ſighted than others, we bid
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95697:56"/>farewel to true Humility and Submiſſion.</p>
            <p>Under Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. this point firſt began to be call'd in queſtion betwixt two Religious Orders, who in order to take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of the matter, appointed a Congregation compoſed of Cardinals, and the moſt Learned Divines in <hi>Rome.</hi> Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. reviv'd the ſaid Congregation, with an intention to give a final deciſion in the matter; but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ariſen betwixt him and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> having diverted his thoughts another way, all theſe great preparations produc'd no other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but only a Decree from the Court of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, forbiding all Members of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Church to Write, or enter into any Diſpute, or to accuſe one another of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or erroneous Opinions concerning the Doctrine of <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this prohibition was not ſufficient to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie a certain Biſhop of <hi>Ypres</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> (whoſe Name was <hi>Cornelius Janſenius</hi>) a Man of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profound Learning, to write a Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Doctrine in a very lofty Stile, as believing, that his frequently peruſing and pondering upon <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who was always look'd upon as the true Oracle of <hi>Grace,</hi> he had ſurmounted all difficulties relating to this Controverſie.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>This Book was Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firſt time at</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, 1639.</note> It was upon this aſſurance that the Biſhop flatter'd himſelf to have found out the true meaning of this Doctor, and to have received his Doctrine in its genuine Purity, free from the errors, which had been neglected in the <hi>Catholick</hi> Schools for above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years paſt; but theſe his ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences were not able to exempt his Book from the cenſure of Pope <hi>Urban</hi> VIII. who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95697:56"/>it, without making the leaſt Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon any of his Propoſitions in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, alledging only for a reaſon, becauſe the Doctrine contained in this Book might revive ſome errors, formerly condemned, as ſuch by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> had hitherto ſtood neuter, the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there having eſpous'd neither ſide, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it began to make ſuch noiſe in the World, a certain ſet of Men, of an extraordinary Zeal, and great Auſterity of Life, beſides this well vers'd in all manner of Learning, and Writing upon moſt Subjects with a great deal of Politeneſs, began firſt to make this Book the object of their Solitary Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and afterwards publickly to eſpouſe the Quarrel with ſo much boldneſs, that they ſpared no Body in their Writings, a fault commonly belonging to thoſe who are very zealous and paſſionate for Novelties. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary reputation of the Author, the moment of the point in queſtion, but above all, the great and ſo much admired Name of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who appear'd in the Frontiſpiece of the Book; add to this the merits of the Perſons who had engaged in its defence, their intreagues and Cabals, all this together had made this Book ſo Famous throughout the whole Kingdom, that it was the chief object of Entertainment among the Learned, who for the moſt part talk'd of nothing ſo much as of the Triumph and Omnipotency of <hi>Grace</hi> over the Free-Will.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, thoſe that oppos'd themſelves to this new broach'd Doctrine, pretended to evince, that what was contain'd
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95697:57"/>in the Biſhop's Book, was no more than a repetition of thoſe Errors maintain'd by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> in reſpect of the Myſtery of <hi>Grace.</hi> Both Parties maintaining their Opinions with ſo much heat, that things ſeem'd to tend to ſome remarkable Revolution in the Church, if the Biſhops had not given as many eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of their Zeal for the ſuppreſſing of this new Doctrine, as its Defenders ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eagerneſs in propagating and ſpreading it among the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> being about that time involv'd in heavy both Foreign and Civil Wars, it was impoſſible to call together either a National or Provincial Aſſembly, for which reaſon, fourſcore and five Biſhops writ to Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> X. to intreat his Holineſs, to put an end to theſe Controverſies, by giving his deciſive Opinion, concerning theſe five Propoſitions, which they ſaid, were the Foundation, and as it were the Abridgment of the whole Doctrine contain'd in the Book of <hi>Janſenius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Diſciples on the other Hand were not negligent in the matter, but ſent ſome of their Members to <hi>Rome,</hi> who endeavour'd to maintain their Doctrine, both in ſeveral Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Audiences which were granted them by the Pope, and in thoſe Congregations which were held in the Pope's Preſence, to debate upon a matter of ſo great moment. But all their efforts proved fruitleſs, their Arguments not being ſtrong enough to convince the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, who condemned and declared the following Propoſitions as Heretical.</p>

            <p>Before the Condemnation of theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, there was no Body, who in the leaſt doubted, but that they were the ſame which <hi>Janſenius</hi> had maintain'd in his Treatiſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince all thoſe who had eſpouſed his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had declared them to be ſo in <hi>Flanders, France,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> both in publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, in their Writings and Diſputes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true ſenſe of the Doctrine of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi> But no ſooner were they condemn'd by the Pope, but the ſame Perſons, who not long before had ſtood up in their defence with ſo much eagerneſs, declar'd publickly, that theſe five Propoſitions were no where to be met with in the Writings of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> or at leaſt not in the ſame ſenſe as they had been preſented to the Pope, and that being only an Invention of ſome of his Proſelytes, this Condemnation did not in the leaſt impair the reputation of the Book or the Author.</p>
            <p>This diſpute cauſed ſo much heat among both Parties, that there appear'd greater ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities about the matter of Fact, than there had been before concerning the true merits of the Cauſe; wherefore an Aſſembly of Biſhops being called together,
<note place="margin">March 9, 1654.</note> gave their Opinion in expreſs Terms; <hi>That theſe were the Propoſitions of</hi> Janſenius, <hi>and were Condemned as ſuch, in the ſame ſenſe as he had maintained them in his Treatiſe.</hi> This Declaration was not long after confirm'd by a Brief from <hi>Rome,</hi> with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Formular</hi> annex'd to it.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> May 1654. <hi>In</hi> Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1656.</note> Two Aſſemblies were held in <hi>France</hi> on the account of this <hi>Formular,</hi> in which it was reſolved by the Biſhops there preſent, that the ſaid <hi>Formular</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:95697:58"/>ſhould be ſubſcribed by all the Biſhops and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eccleſiaſticks of each Dioceſe. But theſe reſolutions were not put in execution at that time, but the matter hung in ſuſpenſe, till the King interpoſing his Authority, brought it to perfection.</p>
            <p>After he had taken the Reins of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into his own Hands, his chiefeſt care was, how to find out ſuitable remedies againſt theſe Inteſtine Diviſions, which revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him that moſt terrible <hi>Idea</hi> of all the miſchiefs and misfortunes, which, occaſioned by the followers of the Doctrine of <hi>Calvin,</hi> had afflicted the Kingdom for theſe thirty Years laſt paſt. When he recall'd to mind and ſeriouſly reflected how by the intreagues of this Sect, above a Million of the braveſt of his Subjects had been Maſſacred, or kill'd in the Wars, how above three hundred goodly Cities had been deſtroy'd, and the moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and Richeſt Families in <hi>France</hi> were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near extirpated; the more, I ſay, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon theſe Calamities, the more he judged it becoming his preſent ſtation, to ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle in the very Cradle this growing Evil, which in time might prove fatal both to Church and State.</p>
            <p>The Followers of <hi>Janſenius</hi> refuſing to ſign the <hi>Formular,</hi> purſuant to the Orders of the Aſſemblies, alledging, that they had no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to oblige them to it, the King applied himſelf to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. deſiring him to preſcribe another <hi>Formular,</hi> and by his Bull to Command every Body to ſubſcribe it.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Bull was dated</hi> Feb. 15. 1665.</note> But after this Bull had been obtain'd, they publickly proteſted they could not in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95697:59"/>ſubſcribe any <hi>Formular</hi> which declar'd the Propoſitions to belong to <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and that they had been Condemn'd as ſuch: That neither the Pope nor the Church it ſelf being Infallible in things relating to matter of Fact, they ought not to be forced to a blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. That their Eyes and Reaſons were the moſt natural Guides and Judges of matter of Fact; that indeed Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and three ſeveral Aſſemblies of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had given their Judgment in the matter, and declared theſe Propoſitions to be the ſame, maintain'd by <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and they had been Condemn'd as ſuch, but that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to agree with them in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they having perus'd and examin'd the Book of <hi>Janſenius</hi> with all the Candour and Exactneſs imaginable, and nevertheleſs had not been able to find out theſe Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>To this it was anſwer'd, that to argue at that rate, was in effect, to declare in plain terms, that the Pope and the Biſhops had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly Condemn'd an Innocent Prelate, and had declar'd a Book Heretical, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but the pure Doctrine of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi> What a horrid confuſion, ſaid they, muſt this produce, if it be allow'd that the Church may err to that degree, as to declare and condemn a moſt excellent Book, which contains nothing but the pureſt Truth, as a Work of the Devil? Tho' it muſt be confeſs'd, that generally ſpeaking, the Church is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible as to every particular in matters of Fact, it is nevertheleſs undeniable, that in matters of the greateſt conſequence, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolutely to its Tranquillity, and the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95697:59"/>maintaining of Church Diſcipline, the Church cannot be in the dark, but ought to be the Teſt of our Faith; for how could ſhe be the Pillar of Truth, if ſhe could be guilty of ſuch enormous errors, as to oblige us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt ſevere puniſhments to receive that for real Truth, which in effect is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe Diſputes maintain'd with equal heat on both ſides, were likely to have continu'd for ever, if the King to put an end to the Controverſie, had not thought fit to put the laſt Bull in execution, and to exhort the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to take forth with effectual care, that the <hi>Formular</hi> ſhould be ſubſcribed by all the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks, without exception, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Dioceſes; commanding his Officers to aſſiſt them in their Zeal, and to give him an exact account of their Proceedings.</p>
            <p>When they ſaw the King abſolutely reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to break the neck of this Controverſie by his Authority, all obey'd, and theſe Prelates themſelves who had hitherto publickly proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the ſigning of the <hi>Formular,</hi> following the footſteps of the reſt, <hi>Janſeniſm</hi> was quite ſuppreſs'd, all Diſputes ceas'd, and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was reſtor'd both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>During this Calm the King employed part of his time in erecting moſt magnificent Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in ſeveral places,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Octob. 1668.</note> but eſpecially the Palace of <hi>Verſailles,</hi> which from a ſimple Hunting Rendezvous, was (by his Orders) in a little time made one of the fineſt places in the World: For, in leſs than two Years time, in a barren Ground, without Water, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advantages, there appear'd vaſt Allies of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95697:60"/>Trees, ſpacious Groves and Labyrinths, a whole Foreſt of Orange-Trees: Here you might feaſt your Eyes with Statues of the beſt Marble without number, and Ciſterns of a prodigious bigneſs of the ſame Materials: Whereever you turn'd your ſelf, you ſaw Fountains with their Ciſterns adorned with <hi>Coloſſus</hi>'s of Braſs, or moſt excellent Figures of the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Marble of a prodigious bigneſs, with an infinite number of Water-ſpouts, and a Canal that reaches out of ſight. To be ſhort, all that may be ſeen, that is either extraordinary or ſurpriſing in the moſt famous and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Structures, is to be met with here, there being nothing that ſurpaſſes this Palace in Magnificence; if you ſee it from any of the neighbouring Hills, it affords the fineſt and moſt delightful Proſpect, that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. The inſide of this Pallace is in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects anſwerable to its outward Grandeur. The moſt exquiſite pieces which being done by the Hand of the greateſt Maſter of our Age,
<note place="margin">Le Brun.</note> adorn the chiefeſt Apartments; the fine Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries, interwoven with Gold, ineſtimable both for their Beauty and Workmanſhip; that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Quantity of Plate,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The King Sacrificed all his large Silver Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to the Neceſſity of the State,</hi> 1689.</note> that variety of ſilver Cups, Baſons, and other Veſſels of all ſorts, which are to be ſeen upon the Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board Tables; all theſe admirable pieces being the Objects of our higheſt admiration, are to be valued by a ſilent ſurprize.</p>
            <p>The King taking a more than ordinary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſo fine a place, he made it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Reſidence of his Court, which at that time appear'd in ſuch ſplendour, that nothing was comparable to it in any other place, this
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95697:60"/>great Prince ſparing no Coſt to make it appear the moſt magnificent in the World. All this did not proceed from any vain Oſtentation, or purely to indulge his Pleaſure, but from a real intention to augment thereby in the People, the reſpect and eſteem due to the Soveraign; and to raiſe in Foreigners an <hi>Idea</hi> of the Riches of the Kingdom, and of the Grandeur of the Prince that ſways the Scepter. But theſe were but weak and tranſitory Appearances of his Greatneſs; his Riches, Power and Generoſity in affording timely Succours to his Allies,

But as his growing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation could not but be a great Eye-ſore to his Jealous Neighbours, who were kept in continual Alarm by ſo Potent a Prince, ſo they left no Stone unturn'd to thwart his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and to ſtop the career of his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>Among others, <hi>Charles</hi> IV. then Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> was one of the moſt active againſt him.

                  <hi>Conduct of the Duke of</hi> Lorrain</note> He was a Perſon equally dexterous in adviſing and executing, a brave Soldier and great Captain, but the moſt unquiet and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant of all Men living, whoſe delight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fiſh in troubled Waters, was always in motion, always raiſing Soldiers, always in the Field; making a Trade of Soldiery, chooſing one ſide to Day, and another to Morrow, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging without diſtinction his Subjects, his Friends and Foes; a Character more ſuitable to a <hi>Cham of Tartary,</hi> than to a Soveraign of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95697:61"/>a ſmall Principality, whoſe Intereſt is to be gentle, and live peaceably, and to obſerve ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an exact Neutrality, or to ſhelter himſelf under the Protection of the moſt Potent of his Neighbouring Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. having ſeized upon <hi>Lorrain</hi> to chaſtiſe the Duke for his many malicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, he marched with his Troops into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he gather'd vaſt Riches, by ſelling their Service at an exceſſive rate, at the beginning of each Campaign putting his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Pay into his own Pocket, and affording them no other Subſiſtence, than full liberty to live at Diſcretion where-ever they came, and to Pillage the Country at pleaſure. The loud Complaints of the People, the little account the Duke made of the <hi>Spaniſh Miniſters,</hi> with whom he would frequently make his Sport, having at laſt occaſioned great Jealouſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he was ſecured, and not ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, till after the Concluſion of <hi>the General Peace.</hi> By vertue of this <hi>Treaty</hi> he was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Dominions, but refuſing to accept of theſe Conditions, ſome more favourable were agreed on, in a particular Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded not above two or three Days before the Death of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next following Year the ſaid Duke having a Diſguſt at his Family, propoſed his two Dutchies as a Gift to the King, and as a Pledge of his ſincere Intentions, offered to ſurrender <hi>Marſal</hi> into his Hands.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Febr. 1652.</note> The Treaty was no ſooner concluded and ſigned, but the Duke, according to his wonted cuſtom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make many Evaſions, and by ſeveral Delays fifteen or ſixteen Months paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95697:61"/>the leaſt probability of performing his Promiſe, till finding the place inveſted by the King's Troops, who were ready to Beſiege it, he was conſtrained to deliver it up.</p>
            <p>During the Wars in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1663.</note> it was much againſt his Will that he aſſiſted the King with four or five Regiments, as it plainly appear'd the Year following, when he left nothing unattempted to debauch them.</p>
            <p>After the Concluſion of the <hi>Peace</hi> at <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> it was the Wonder of all the World to ſee him augment his Troops, to make new Levies, and enter into new Alliances. The King was not wanting on his ſide to give him timely notice, that he was not ignorant of thoſe Tranſactions; but his ill Stars having made him inſenſible of his true Intereſt, and incapable of receiving good Council, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his former courſe, till the King found himſelf under an abſolute Neceſſity to drive him out of his Dominions.</p>
            <p>The Duke was ſo generally hated,

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95697:62"/>to embroil <hi>Europe,</hi> and conſequently were extreamly glad to have met with a Prince of his Character, who might be very ſerviceable to them in ſpreading about fears and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, thereby to raiſe againſt the King ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Enemies, as might, under pretence of protecting this Prince, ſerve as a Check to the Greatneſs of <hi>France.</hi> A fatal Maxim of State! which had almoſt proved the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and in effect brought them to the very brink of ruine.</p>

But for four or five Years paſt they had been ſo much blinded with Vain-glory, and their Affluence of Fortune, that by their Vanities they had drawn upon themſelves the hatred of all their Neighbours.

They did without intermiſſion form Cabals in all Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> being very prodigal of their Money to ſet on foot new Alliances againſt him, and that with ſo little reſpect to his Perſon, that they did not make any Secret of the matter, adjuging it to be of ſuch a nature as to be paſs'd all Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95697:64"/>have ſaved themſelves that trouble, the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt being not to ſtrike on that ſide. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had provided all the ſmall Places round about <hi>Maſtrick,</hi> with good Garriſons, to block up that place, he directed his March towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where having divided his Forces into four ſeveral Bodies, he ordered <hi>Orſoy, Weſel, Rhinberg</hi> and <hi>Burick</hi> to be Beſieged all at a time.</p>
            <p>They being all Frontier Places, were very well fortified and provided with good Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and all other Neceſſaries for their defence; notwithſtanding which they made but a feeble Reſiſtance, the King's Troops having forced them to a Surrender within four or five Days time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rhinberg,</hi> which was Beſieged by the King in Perſon, ſurrendred without Diſcharging a Cannon.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the King's Brother, was forced to make uſe of his Artillery for a few Hours before <hi>Orſoy.</hi> For which reaſon the King, to terrifie the other Garriſons from being ſo preſumptuous for the future, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Surrendring at the firſt Summons, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that both the Officers and Souldiers ſhould be made Priſoners of War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Burick</hi> was but one Days work for the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Turenne;</hi> and <hi>Weſel</hi> ſurrendred at diſcretion to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> ſo ſoon as he had made himſelf Maſter of a certain Fort which commanded the place.</p>
            <p>The unexpected Surrender of theſe four Towns, ſtruck ſuch a terrour into the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Rees,</hi> that they did not hold out above two Days, tho it be undeniable, that its Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95697:65"/>were at that time as compleat and regular as any in <hi>Europe. Emmerick</hi> was as ſoon Surrendred as Beſieged; and <hi>Doctkum</hi> gave us no other trouble than to ſend thither a Brigade to take poſſeſſion of it. Five or ſix more leſſer places opened their Gates at the approach of their Victorious Enemies, without the leaſt Formalities of a Capitulation.</p>
            <p>All this being performed within the ſpace of eight Days, the King was for improving the Conſternation of the People to his Advantage, and for puſhing on his Fortune with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Vigour; his firſt Reſolution was to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and at the ſame time to force the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in his Entrenchments. This young Prince, the only Off-ſpring, and true Heir of all the vaſt Poſſeſſions and noble Qualifications of thoſe great Men of the ſame Name, (his Anceſtors) who laid the firſt Foundation of this <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> lay In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd near the Banks of the <hi>Yſſel,</hi> with an Army of five and twenty Thouſand Men; but both theſe Deſigns being not to be put in Execution, without the hazard of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men, and the loſs of much time, the King changed his Reſolution, and order'd his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to march towards the Iſle of <hi>Betaw,</hi> with an intention, to try, whether thereabouts they might not find a convenient Paſſage over the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Waters of the <hi>Rhine</hi> were very low at that Seaſon,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The King paſſes the</hi> Rhine, 12.

Two Gentlemen living
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95697:65"/>thereabouts, having ſhew'd the Ford to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> he ordered it immediately to be ſounded, which proved ſo ſhallow that Horſe might paſs without much danger, they being to ſwim no further than about the length of an hundred Paces. The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamly rejoyced at this welcome News, reſolved not to ſtay for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the Bridge of Boats, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without looſing any further time, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by Break of Day out of his Camp, at the Head of his <hi>Gens d' Arms,</hi> his Guards and <hi>Chevaux legers,</hi> beſides a Detachment of two Thouſand Horſe, towards the Banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where he was to be met by the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was obſervable, that the King appear'd more brisk and reſolute at that time, than he had done for a great while before; the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aſſurance that appear'd in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, being a happy Preſage of good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the Soldiery, he no ſooner order'd the Signal to be given, but firſt a great number of Voluntiers, the <hi>French</hi> Regiment of Curaſſiers, and the Troops of the King's Houſhold threw themſelves into the River, with an unparallell'd Reſolution, relying more upon their own Courage, than the uſe of their Arms. The <hi>Rhine,</hi> tho of a conſiderable breadth in this place, yet runs with a Current ſo ſwift and violent, as if it were forced through a very ſtreight Channel. Beſides this, it having blown a Storm the Night before, the high Winds toſſed dreadful Waves againſt the Shore, which well might have terrified the Soldiers from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting the Paſſage at that time; but being
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95697:66"/>by their King's Preſence inſpired with a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to deſpiſe all Danger, neither the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Current, nor the dreadful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the high Waves, nor the ſight of their Enemies, who lay entrench'd on the other ſide ready to receive them, nothing of all this could daunt their Courage, or ſtop their Progreſs; there were but a few loſt in this Paſſage, who being carried away from the reſt by the violence of the Stream, were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the Waves, or periſhed in the Whirlpools.</p>
            <p>As they began to approach the other ſide of the Shoar, they were vigorouſly attack'd by three Squadrons of the Enemy, who being entred the River, killed and wounded ſome of our Men; but finding our Troops to advance without being daunted, they after their firſt Charge retreated, and betook themſelves to their Heels: Then it was that the <hi>French</hi> Horſe encouraging one another by their joyful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, reach'd the Bank of the River, and tho they were all dropping wet, purſued the Flying Enemy for above a League.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> Battallions that lay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd at the Entrance of a Wood; they were ſo terrified at the very ſight of the <hi>French,</hi> that in lieu of making good the Paſs, they threw down their Arms. The Prince promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them Quarter, ſeverely forbidding any Body to attack them; but his Nephew the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> being ignorant of it, committed an act of imprudence, in firing one of his Piſtols juſt near their Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which coſt him his Life; for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95697:66"/>believing that they were advancing to cut them to pieces, betook themſelves again to their Arms, and at their firſt Diſcharge killed the Duke with five more Perſons of Quality, and wounded a conſiderable number, amongſt whom was <hi>Armand du Cambout,</hi> Duke of <hi>Coſſelin,</hi> a Peer of <hi>France;</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was drawn thither by the noiſe and diſcharging of the Fire Arms, was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Piſtol-ſhot in his Wriſt. The <hi>French</hi> being exaſperated at the loſs of their Officers and Comerades, cut moſt of the Enemy in pieces, except ſome who ſaved themſelves by flight.</p>
            <p>The King in the mean while ſaw the other Regiments of Horſe paſs the River one after another, Squadron by Squadron, with leſs danger than before, the great number of Horſe that ſwam cloſe together, breaking in a great meaſure the violence of the Waves, and ſwiftneſs of the Current. The next Day following, the Bridge being got ready, all the Infantry paſs over it with the whole Train of Artillery.</p>
            <p>It is not to be expreſs'd, what a noiſe this Action ſo bravely undertaken, and ſo prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manag'd did make in the World; the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for fear of being ſurpriſed, thought it his beſt way to quit his Intrenchments, and by long Marches retreated deeper into the Country. The generality of the People being fill'd with Conſternation, put all the hopes of their Safety in the Mercy of their Conqueror; which they endeavoured to purchaſe from his Hands, by ſtriving (as it may be ſaid) who ſhould be the firſt that ſhould put themſelves
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95697:67"/>under his Protection. The Soldiers got an incredible Booty, wallowing for two Months together in Plenty and Riches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doesburg</hi> and <hi>Arnheim</hi> did not hold out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four and twenty Hours after opening of the Trenches.</p>
            <p>The Fort of <hi>Skink (Shencken Skans)</hi> ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous both for its Strength and Situation, and the long and vigorous Attacks it has ſo brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſtained at other times, ſurrendred before the opening of the Trenches.</p>
            <p>The Forts of <hi>Woeren</hi> and St. <hi>Andrew</hi> did the ſame.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> tho ſecured by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places of good Strength, ſent the Keys of their Gates to the Victorious Enemy at a good diſtance: All Places in the <hi>Betaw</hi> followed their Example, and there were very few Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the <hi>Wahle</hi> and <hi>Yſſel,</hi> but what readily opened their Gates and received Safeguards.</p>
            <p>In the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Oudewater, Voerden,</hi> and <hi>Narden</hi> were alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the King's Forces, and <hi>Amſterdam</hi> it ſelf, that proud and potent City, was upon the point of Capitulating, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the brave Efforts of ſome of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, would have been forced to ſubmit to the King's Conquering Arms, if the Officer who commanded in our moſt advanced Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, had not been careleſs in intrenching himſelf immediately, in a ſmall place called <hi>Muyden;</hi> from whence we might have bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd all their Ships going to <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> a fatal Neglect, which preſerved the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince from falling into our hands.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:95697:67"/>
            <p>Empires as well as other things have their certain Periods, and Critical Minutes, which if known and dexterouſly managed, prove commonly fatal to them. In the mean time <hi>Francis Henry de Montmorency</hi> Duke of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburgh,</hi> having with a conſiderable Body of Troops, and many experienced Officers, joined the Forces of the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne,</hi> (who being diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the <hi>Hollanders</hi>) were re-entred into a League with the King againſt them) had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered a third Province.</p>
            <p>The Duke after having put Safeguards into ſeven or eight ſmall places, Beſieged in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> the City of <hi>Groll.</hi> This ſtrong place having ſurrendred without making any reſiſtance, the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Forces being joined with the reſt, they Beſieged the City of <hi>Deventer,</hi> which being ſoon forced to come to a Capitulation, thoſe of <hi>Zwoll</hi> and <hi>Campen,</hi> and generally all the other Places of the Province of <hi>Overyſſel</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their Example.</p>
            <p>To make due reflection upon theſe ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Events, they appear ſo extraordinary and prodigious, as to be almoſt paſt belief; for it is ſcarce poſſible to imagin, that ſo many brave Cities, which hitherto had paſt for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, ſhould, without making any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, have ſurrender'd at diſcretion, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if it be conſider'd, that moſt of them being provided with good Garriſons, and that in a Country, which for a conſiderable time had been accounted the School of War in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> ſcarce any of their ſtrong holds to have defended themſelves above four and twenty
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95697:68"/>hours, except <hi>Zutphen</hi> and <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the firſt of which held out four, and the laſt nine days.</p>
            <p>But, when People after the Fatigues of a tedious War, enjoy the fruits of a glorious Peace, they begin to abandon themſelves to their pleaſures, which renders them careleſs of their own ſecurity, and of improving Martial Diſcipline, one of the Pillars of the State. A Nation being thus inveigled and dazled with their preſent good Fortune, are ſoon brought into confuſion, at the leaſt miſchance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> being reduced to this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and ſeeing themſelves in moſt imminent danger of becoming an abſolute Prey to the K's Conquering Arms, judg'd it moſt conducible to their preſent condition to ſue for Peace; for which reaſon the States deputed ſome to the King, to know upon what terms he would be pleas'd to grant it, and at the ſame time ſent to <hi>Charles</hi> II. then King of <hi>England,</hi> to be informed concerning his Pretenſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
            <p>For it is to be obſerved, that it was not the <hi>French</hi> King alone, who was offended at the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> they had given great cauſes of complaint to the King of <hi>England,</hi> by their Inſolence both to him and his Subjects, by troubling their Commerce, and eſpecially by fomenting diviſions betwixt that Prince and his People, which ever ſince the Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at <hi>Breda,</hi> they had look'd upon as the main pont of their own ſecurity. Our King being not ignorant in the Art of improving ſo favourable a juncture, and how to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the injuries receiv'd by the <hi>Dutch</hi> to King
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95697:68"/>
               <hi>Charles</hi> II. it made ſo lively an impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Monarch, that he quitted the <hi>Triple-Alliance,</hi> and declar'd open War to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having equipp'd a Gallant Fleet, the ſame was joyn'd by the <hi>French</hi> in the Channel, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> threatned with a moſt powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion by Sea; but the Enemies had ſecured themſelves ſo well at Sea, and had provided a Fleet ſo numerous, and well mann'd, that when the Fleets of both Crowns engaged them on the 7th of <hi>June,</hi> they could, after a moſt bloody and obſtinate Fight, boaſt of no other advantage, than to have chaſed them towards their own Coaſts, and made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their own Ports.</p>
            <p>The Propoſitions of Peace made by the two Kings were look'd upon by the <hi>Dutch</hi> as ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and intolerable, that they reſolved rather to bury themſelves in their own Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins, than to purchaſe the Peace at ſuch a Rate. Being therefore reduced to that Extremity as to be forced to take ſuch Meaſures as were moſt ſuitable to their preſent deſperate Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they had recourſe to their Sluces and Dikes, which they opened and pierced through in many places, and put the Country under Water, to ſerve them as a Barricado againſt their Enemies, who were upon the Point of ſnatching from them their ſo much admir'd Liberty: The Remedy appear'd ſo dangerous in the Eyes of all the World, that the moſt conſidered it to be of worſe conſequence than the Evil they feared; but nevertheleſs it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the real cauſe of their Safety.</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:95697:69"/>
            <p>For our King finding all his Meaſures bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by this inſurmountable Obſtacle left <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> leaving the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> to Command in his Abſence, with Orders to take the opportunity of the approaching Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to puſh on his Conqueſts with all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour imaginable, under the favour of the Froſts and Ice. At his Return into <hi>France,</hi> the People charmed with his Preſence after ſo Glorious a Campaign, received him in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and accompanied him through all places where-ever he paſs'd, with all the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acclamations and Vows due to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Troops having taken new Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage after the King's Departure, Beſieged <hi>Voerden</hi> under the Command of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with fourteen Thouſand Men. All the Country round about it lay under Water, there being only one Paſſage left to approach it, which was a Dike on the ſide of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> To cut off from the Town all Communication and hopes of Succours, the Prince had cauſed two Forts to be erected on each ſide of the Dike, and betwixt both a Battery ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a good Intrenchment. But all theſe Fortifications were not ſtrong enough to frighten the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> who after the Siege had laſted two Months, advancing early in the Morning, attack'd them in the Front; but being repulſed there, he was ſo far from giving over his Deſign, that having cauſed the Depth of the Waters to be ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and finding them not above four Foot deep in a certain place which he judged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the Attack, he led his Men with a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95697:69"/>marvellous Reſolution through the Waters, and taking them in Flank made himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of one of their Quarters on that ſide, from whence aſſaulting the Forts, he took them not without a great Slaughter on the Enemies ſide, who being obliged to raiſe the Siege, the Duke provided the place with a ſufficient Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and marched back again to <hi>Utrecht,</hi> with a conſiderable Booty, and a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Priſoners of War.

            </p>
            <p>The braveſt and moſt couragious Action that ever was undertaken, eſpecsally if it be conſidered, that the Duke had not above three Thouſand Men with him, by reaſon that he was not joyn'd by ſome Troops which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have met him in his March accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Orders, and becauſe that the <hi>French</hi> Troops were not very numerous at that time thereabouts, the Viſcount of <hi>Turenne</hi> having lately been reinforced from thence with a good Body of the beſt Regiments, to obſerve the Motions of the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The more all the Neighbouring Princes were ſurprized at the ſtupendious progreſs of the King's Arms,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>War with the Elector of</hi> Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</note> the more they judged it for their Intereſts to put a ſtop to his Conqueſts. It is not to be imagined that it was ſo much out of Compaſſion, or the Conſideration of the deplorable Condition, to which this ſo flouriſhing and potent Commonwealth had been reduced within the ſpace of two Months, that made them take theſe Meaſures to prevent its ruine by their aſſiſtance; but their own Fears and Jealouſies, which repreſented to them <hi>Europe</hi> in Chains, and as a Vaſſal of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95697:70"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> if the King ſhould Conquer the <hi>United Provinces;</hi> what Wonder then if all were ready to lend a helping hand to preſerve that from whence depended in a great meaſure their own Safeties; whilſt ſome therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to obtain their aim by ſecret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, others preſented themſelves with their Swords in Hand.</p>
            <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> was the firſt who ſhew'd himſelf moſt concern'd for the Preſervation of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whether it was that their Money had had more influence over him than the reſt, and made him more Zealous for their Intereſt; or whether it were that he was diſſatisfied at our King for not reſtoring to him ſome Places, which belonged to him, and were taken by our Troops from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> I will not pretend to determine. It is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable that he was a Prince very aſpiring and ambitious, one of the braveſt Men living, and of great Experience in Martial Affairs, who maintain'd at that time an Army of twenty five Thouſand Men, who wanted to be employed ſome where or other. Add to this the Sollicitations of his Nephew the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who earneſtly intreated him to employ his Forces for the Relief of <hi>Holland,</hi> which might ſerve as the moſt effectual means in the World to eſtabliſh his Reputation among them. So ſure it is that all the Ties of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity are weak, if not ſtrengthned and link'd together by Intereſt. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> offered to one of the Elector's Sons all the Dignities belonging to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> if that Family ſhould happen to be extinct; the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was of a weak
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95697:70"/>Conſtitution, and Unmarried at that time, who expoſed his Perſon unto the hazard of War upon a thouſand occaſions. Theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Hopes, tho very remote, a good Sum of ready Money, and the Glory of being the firſt that had ſo much Courage as to oppoſe the Victorious Arms of our King, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to prove the Deliverer of ſo great and famous a Commonwealth, all theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, I ſay, joyn'd together, induced the Elector to declare againſt <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The number of his Forces was very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in compariſon of ours at a time when the King having been obliged to diſperſe moſt of his Troops in his late Conqueſts, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to fifty or threeſcore ſtrong places, there was but a ſlender ſhare left to keep the Field. So ſoon as we received Intelligence that the Elector's Army was ready to march, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was ordered to march with all ſpeed to meet him on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhing</hi> with his ſmall Army, conſiſting only of twelve Thouſand Men; the Elector's Army by ſeveral Reinforcements, was near thirty five thouſand. But if the Elector was ſtronger in number of Men, the Viſcount was ſuperiour in Officers, and ſuch as were all true Soldiers, who being all choſen Men, and fluſh'd with their late good Succeſs, did breath after nothing ſo much, as freſh opportunity of acquiring new Glory.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had the Elector been advertiſed of our March, but he firſt made a Halt, and perceiving that the Viſcount intended to expect his coming, he retreated, and repaſſed the River <hi>Weſer;</hi> if it was a Surprize to all the World to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95697:71"/>ſee the Elector fly from an Army much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in number to his, it was the more aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing to ſee the <hi>French</hi> purſue him over the <hi>Weſer,</hi> with an incredible Swiftneſs, to force all the Places that durſt oppoſe them, to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage the flat Country, and to take up their Winter-Quarters in his Territories.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got together an Army of near fourſcore Thouſand Men,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Charleroy</note> was advanced towards <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrick,</hi> with an intention to free in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his own Country from the Burthen of the War, by carrying it into another; for which purpoſe after ſeveral Marches and Countermarches, ſeeming to threaten ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Tongres,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Maſtrick,</hi> he at laſt Beſieged <hi>Charleroy,</hi> a place ſituate upon the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and of no ſmall conſequence to us, by reaſon of its moſt convenient ſituation to conduct our Convoys and Recruits into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> tho they had very lately gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the King freſh aſſurances of their ſincere Intentions, and that they deſired nothing ſo much as to cultivate a good Underſtanding with him, nevertheleſs had furniſhed ten Thouſand Men for the better carrying on of this Enterprize.</p>
            <p>The Place was at that time unprovided with a ſufficient Garriſon to make a vigorous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the Governour was abſent, and the <hi>French</hi> had no Army ready at hand to relieve it, ſo that every thing ſeem'd to concur for the advantage of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who, it was believ'd, would be Maſter of the place in eight Days. But our King in the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95697:71"/>he received the News of the Siege, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd his Orders into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to aſſemble his Troops with all poſſible ſpeed, he himſelf left <hi>Verſailles</hi> in a few Days after to haſten their March, and to put himſelf at the Head of them in order to relieve the Place.</p>
            <p>The Rumour of the King's Departure being ſoon ſpread in the Enemies Camp,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Charleroy <hi>raiſed.</hi>
               </note> ſtruck ſuch a Terrour among them, that without more ado they raiſed the Siege.</p>
            <p>This was a killing ſtroak to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who being in hopes that by ſo powerful a Diverſion the face of Affairs would ſoon change for the better on his ſide, and that the <hi>French</hi> would be obliged to recal their Troops out of his Territories, in order to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour <hi>Charleroy;</hi> but finding himſelf abſolutely diſappointed in his Expectation, he took other Meaſures and ſued for Peace. The King, to make him ſenſible of his Errour, kept him in ſuſpenſe for two or three Months, in the mean while that his Troops conſumed all what was left in the Countries of <hi>Marck</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vensbergh.</hi> This obliged the Elector to be more preſſing than ever for a Peace, which he at laſt obtain'd from the King, who in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his Submiſſion granted him more than he could have expected to have got by the War, and his own Courage. For the King promiſed to reſtore to him, within a certain time limitted, all the Places belonging to him in the Dutchy of <hi>Cleves,</hi> which was executed accordingly in the next following Year; but the Treaty was but little obſerved on the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's ſide, who was no ſooner got into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95697:72"/>of theſe Places, but took up Arms again, and declared againſt <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Concluſion of this Treaty, the King having now laid aſide his deſign of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering <hi>Holland,</hi> nevertheleſs had taken a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> at the beginning of this Campaign, knowing it to be one of the main Bull-works of the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This City has been famous ever ſince the laſt Age, when it was firſt ſurrounded with a good Fortification, by the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards taken by the Forces of the States, and retaken by Storm by the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and in the Year 1632. once more taken by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> after a Siege of two Months. Its ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is one of the moſt convenient in the World, being built on purpoſe to keep the whole Province of <hi>Brabant,</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Liege,</hi> the Country of <hi>Limburgh, Cleves</hi> and <hi>Gueldres</hi> in awe, which together with the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the adjacent Country,

                  <hi>Deſcription of</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht.</note> its Traffick, Number and Induſtry of the Inhabitants, has made it at all times to be conſidered as the Key and Bullwork of all the circumjaceat Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which has been the reaſon the <hi>Dutch</hi> have not been ſparing in any thing which might add to its ſtrength. It is ſituate upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> which ſeparates it from the Suburbs called the <hi>Wick,</hi> very well fortify'd and joyn'd to the City by a Stone-Bridge. The Body of the Place, to the Land-ſide, is fortify'd with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and moſt regular Fortifications that are to be ſeen in all <hi>Flanders,</hi> with Ravelins, Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and many Hornworks, all ſecured with deep Ditches. Their Magazines were at that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95697:72"/>time well provided with all things neceſſary to ſuſtain a Siege. There was in the Place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counting the Inhabitants that were capable of bearing Arms, a Garriſon of ſix or ſeven thouſand Men of their beſt Troops, under the Command of an old Officer, whoſe Name was <hi>Fariaux,</hi> a Man no leſs Brave than expert in all Matters relating to the Defence of a Place of ſuch importance; and the States ſeem'd to be reſolved to Sacrifice every thing for the preſervation of it. Nevertheleſs, in ſpite of all theſe Advantages, this ſtrong City ſo couragiouſly defended, was not able to hold out againſt the King above thirteen Days.</p>
            <p>For the King was no ſooner arrived in the Camp,
<note place="margin">

                  </gap>icht</note> but having taken an exact view of the whole ſituation of the Place, he ordered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the Lines of Circumvallation and Contravallation to be made, and aſſigned the Quarters for their Batteries. Five of theſe were in a condition to play within three Days, and the Lines perfected much about the ſame time, tho the Lines of Circumvallation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eight Leagues in Circuit, and that both of them were ten Foot high, and twelve broad. The next following Day the Trenches being opened, they advanced the firſt Night within a ſmall diſtance from the convert way. It is next to an impoſſibility to conceive with what diſpatch Matters were carried on in this Siege. But it muſt alſo be confeſs'd, that if the King's Subjects were not ſparing in their Labour, and undergoing all the Fatigues that can be imagined; he on his ſide gave ſuch Proofs of his Valour, Liberality and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95697:73"/>that all the World muſt acknowledge him to be worthy to Command ſuch brave Fellows. For he appear'd every where, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Attacks in Perſon, animating them by his Preſence, by his Liberality, Praiſes and Promiſes of Rewards; he never reſted all Night, not going to Sleep till Six a Clock in the Morning, and getting again on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back immediately after Dinner. Amongſt the Variety of Buſineſs which diſtracted his Thoughts without intermiſſion, in an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of ſuch conſequence, he was never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful to enquire after the State of the Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Souldiers, and would ſometimes take his Round among them from Tent to Tent, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Common Soldiers, to ſee whether they ſtood in want of any thing for their Subſiſtence or Recovery. The King having thereby gained the Hearts of all the Soldiery, as his Liberality and Promiſes had raiſed their Courage, they were ready to Sacrifice every thing for his Service, which was the reaſon that the Siege advanced ſo ſucceſsfully, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Beſieged did all that could be expected from Mortal Men to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt us, the Governour being not ſparing either of his Soldiers or Workmen, who ſeem'd to outdo the <hi>French</hi> in repairing their Breaches, and placing new Palliſado's inſtead of thoſe ruin'd by our Cannon.</p>
            <p>But the moſt memorable Action was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the two Attacks made at once upon the Counterſcarp; and it may be ſaid without the leaſt Contradiction to truth, that never was a more dreadful Night known ſince the Memory of Man; for what
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95697:73"/>with the continual Fire from the Fire-locks, Cannon, Mortars, and Hand-Granado's, what with the Cries and Lamentations of the fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wounded Soldiers, what with the Horrour and Slaughter which laſted from the Evening till Break of Day, it is confeſs'd by the conſent of all the moſt experienced Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers there preſent, that never any thing was ſeen like it before. Both Attacks were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on with equal Bravery, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of both Parties, both the Aſſailants and Beſieged, gave a thouſand Proofs of their Valour, which were for the moſt part buried by the obſcurity of the Night.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Granadeers</hi> followed by the <hi>Grand Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers,</hi> all brave young Fellows, and eager after Fighting, began the Attack, and were received with an unparallell'd Bravery by the Beſieged, the Governour having poſted there all the choſen Men of the whole Garriſon, and a good number of Volunteers, who had thrown themſelves in on purpoſe to ſignalize themſelves upon ſo extraordinary an occaſion. Thus the Engagement laſted with equal Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very on both ſides, till the Beſieged were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of a Half-moon; this was taken and re-taken three times in four and twenty Hours, before the <hi>French</hi> could ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it againſt the furious Attacks of the Enemy. Two Days after, they took alſo from them the Horn-work, which the Governour <hi>Fariau</hi> endeavoured to regain, but with ſo ill ſucceſs, that having cauſed a ſmall Mine to be ſprung in hopes to ruine ours, it ſprung backwards, and carried five hundred of his Men up into the Air.</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:95697:74"/>
            <p>This new diſaſter, the fear of being Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and the Miſerable Condition into which the whole place was reduced by our Cannon and Bombs, made the Inhabitants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon a Capitulation: Having accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly made their Addreſs to the Governour, he refuſed to hearken to it, but they earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſting upon their Demand, he anſwer'd, <hi>That he was reſolved to hold it out to the last Extremity.</hi> But after a little while dreading a double Misfortune, to wit, the effects of the enraged Multitude, and of the Enemy, he thought it more prudent to Capitulate upon Honourable Terms, than to expoſe the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, of which there was but one third part remaining fit for Service, to the Slaughter; accordingly he beat a Parley,
<note place="margin">Maſtricht <hi>Surrendred</hi>
               </note> after having defended the place thirteen Days after open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Trenches, with all the Conduct and Courage that could be expected from a brave Officer.</p>
            <p>The Garriſon marched out with Drums beating, Matches lighted, and two pieces of Cannon, the King being not unwilling to grant theſe Honourable Terms to Men that had behaved themſelves with ſo much Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>The taking of <hi>Maſtricht</hi> would in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood have been followed by the Conqueſt of <hi>Boiſleduc</hi> and all the other places of the <hi>Dutch Brabant,</hi> if the Storm that aroſe on the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſide had not drawn the King that way.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95697:74"/>of <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> ſet forth on his Journey to <hi>Nancy,</hi> where he likewiſe order'd the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications to be put in a State of defence, which was put in execution with incredible Diligence in leſs than three Weeks; at the ſame time he ſecured <hi>Colmar</hi> and <hi>Schleſtadt</hi> in his Intereſt, where, as it was believed, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had a ſecret Correſpondence; and having obliged the City of <hi>Strasburgh</hi> by his approach to embrace a Neutrality, he poſſeſt himſelf of the City of <hi>Treves,</hi> to be even with that Elector for the Breach of his Word, and to make it a frontier place, to cover his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions on that ſide. Theſe ſo neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions proved of ſuch conſequence after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to his Affairs, that among all thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies that were ingaged in a League againſt him, during the ſpace of five Years, whilſt the War laſted, and threatned to Invade his Country, none of them could boaſt to have been able to enter his Dominions with ſo much as one ſingle Squadron.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95697:75"/>an Engagement, the Viſcount could not prevent them from paſſing the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in conjunction with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and beſieging <hi>Bonn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This place was without a Ditch, its Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications being not quite brought to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, notwithſtanding which, the <hi>French</hi> Governor, with his Garriſon, conſiſting only of fifteen hundred Men, defended himſelf ſo valiantly againſt ſo powerful an Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of three ſeveral Nations, that they did not become Maſters of it, till after a fourteen Nights Siege. As the Conqueſt of this City, as well as that of <hi>Naerden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Bonn.</note> a ſmall but well Fortified Place in <hi>Holland,</hi> taken from us in the foregoing Month of <hi>September,</hi> by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſeem'd to be the happy Fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the good ſucceſs of this Alliance, ſo the Emperor and <hi>Spain</hi> flatter'd themſelves with the hopes of all thoſe Advantages which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters had put them in hopes of when they enter'd into the League.</p>
            <p>The Emperor enter'd into the Alliance not only upon that ſcore, as having in view thereby to put a ſtop to the greatneſs of <hi>France,</hi> which if it ſhould over-run <hi>Holland</hi> and the Low-Countries, would, like an impetuous Torrent ſpread all over <hi>Germany,</hi> but as look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this as a favourable juncture to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Authority in the Empire. It is very well known that for a conſiderable time paſt, it has been the main deſign of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to make themſelves abſolute in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> by reducing theſe Princes under their Obedience; This ſeem'd to be the moſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical juncture that could be, to put this ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95697:75"/>long projected deſign in execution; the Kings Conqueſts in <hi>Holland,</hi> and his taking the City of <hi>Treves,</hi> were the moſt plauſible pretences in the World to bring a good Army into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> without giving any ſuſpicion to theſe Princes, whom they hop'd to ruin one after another, by drawing them into the Quarrel, under the glorious pretext of taking up Arms for the defence of the Empire.</p>
            <p>As for what concern'd the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they were cajol'd into a League by the fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who offer'd no leſs than the Reſtitution of <hi>Maeſtrick,</hi> after it ſhould be retaken, and engaged themſelves not to make either Peace or Truce with us, before the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould have ſurrender'd to them all what he had taken from them ſince the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renean</hi> Peace. A meer Tinſey wherewith to dazzle the Eyes of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being, to keep no further to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, than they ſhould find it ſuitable to their own Intereſt; as it ſufficiently appear'd at the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> when they oblig'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to accept of the ſame Propoſitions as they were projected by our King.</p>
            <p>The Alliance of ſo many powerful Princes ſeem'd to foretel ſomething extraordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France;</hi> but thinking themſelves not in a condition to undertake any thing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs ſtrengthen'd by the Power of <hi>England,</hi> they left no ſtone unturn'd all that Winter, to bring that King over to their ſide. But all their great offers, and fair promiſes, would have proved fruitleſs upon this King, who ſtood immoveable in his Reſolution of adhering to our Intereſt, if at laſt ſome of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95697:76"/>the Parliament Men, who being perhaps o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with the charms of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Gold,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> Holland.</note> had not preſſed ſo hard upon that King, that being no longer able to reſiſt their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, he made Peace with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> without declaring againſt <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our King was no conſiderable loſer by the concluſion of this Peace, his chiefeſt loſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the recalling of a few <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops; for what had been concerted betwixt theſe two Kings about a Deſcent to be made upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Coaſt, had been found impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they having been ſufficiently convinced by Experience, that nothing of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be expected from Sea Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as to the deciſion of the Fate of a War; witneſs thoſe three ſeveral Sea fights betwixt the Fleets of the two Kings, and that of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in all which, the ballance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſo little different, that it was no eaſie matter to determine which of them ought with Juſtice carry away the Honour of the Victory, there having been ſcarce any other advantage obtained on either ſide, but to make a great noiſe without doing any conſiderable hurt. Thus the <hi>Hollanders</hi> imagined, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now Maſters at Sea, they could not want an opportunity of ravaging our Coaſts, and to make themſelves Maſters of ſome places in <hi>France;</hi> but they have been ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by their ill Succeſs, that unleſs an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be aſſured of a good Port, it is a very difficult task to make a Deſcent, and cannot be undertaken without vaſt Charges, which ſcarce ever quit coſt.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:95697:76"/>
            <p>However, the Peace betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> appear'd to be the Signal to all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who now began to throw off the mask one after another, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd againſt us, except the Elector of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Hanover,</hi> who continued ſtedfaſt in their Neutrality. For the Electors of <hi>Saxony, Mayence,</hi> of <hi>Treves,</hi> and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Palatin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Germany <hi>and</hi> Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into a League.</hi>
               </note> as well as the Landtgraves of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> and Princes of <hi>Baden,</hi> with moſt of the Circles of <hi>Germany</hi> did immediately take up Arms in favour of the Alliance. The Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> left our Party, to embrace that of the Allies; and tho' the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> did not immediately declare againſt <hi>France,</hi> yet did they engage in the Alliance from that time, and promiſed to put themſelves in a poſture of aſſiſting and promoting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now it was that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had all the reaſon in the World to rejoyce at their good Succeſs, ſeeing they had by their good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement transferred the Burthen of the War from their own into their Neighbours Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; the King, ſurrounded on all ſides by his Enemies, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> had raiſed againſt him, having been obliged to abandon all his Conqueſts in the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> (except <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> which ſerved to bridle them) to make uſe of theſe Garriſons againſt the numerous Armies of the Allies. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe Advantages, the <hi>States</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired nothing ſo much as Peace, conſidering that having now recovered what they had
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95697:77"/>loſt, it would be very hard for them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at their own Charge a War, where now they had no further Intereſt, but what they had in common with their Allies.</p>
            <p>After a whole Twelve Months Debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Peace, all Parties concern'd having at laſt accepted the Mediation of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſent their <hi>Plenipotentiaries</hi> to <hi>Cologne,</hi> the place appointed for the carrying on of the Treaty. The Conferences were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted by ſeveral Accidents, and new Difficulties which ariſe from time to time, the <hi>Plenipotentiaries</hi> of the <hi>States-General</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves with great Aſſiduity, and were not without hopes of bringing this grand Affair to a happy Concluſion, if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who was for continuing the War, had not cauſed Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Furſtembergh</hi> (ſince made Cardinal) to be ſeized by force in the open Streets, without the leaſt Reſpect to his Character, he being <hi>Miniſter</hi> and <hi>Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiary</hi> of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and carried him afterwards Priſoner to <hi>Vienna.</hi> He alſo cauſed a Houſe to be Pillaged about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Days after, where there was ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney belonging to the <hi>French</hi> King, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſg to give any reaſonable Satisfaction for theſe Outrages, the Conferences broke off, and both ſides renewed their Preparations with more vigour than ever for the proſecution of the War.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Europe</hi> ſtood in expectation of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this War, there being very few but what were of Opinion, that the King would be forced to be upon the defenſive, foraſmuch as it was ſufficiently known, that the Allies,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95697:77"/>had entred into a mutual Engagement not to hearken to any Peace, unleſs <hi>Lorrain</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to that Duke, <hi>Alſace</hi> to the Emperour, and to <hi>Spain</hi> all what had been taken from them ſince the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Peace. But they were not ſatisfied thus, they had laid their Deſigns to invade <hi>Burgundy, Picardy</hi> and <hi>Champaign,</hi> and to ravage as far as to the very Gates of <hi>Paris;</hi> but thoſe vaſt Projects were leſs difficult to be conceived, than to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For whilſt the Allies were concerting mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,

                  <hi>The Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign of</hi> 1674.</note> and buoying up one another with theſe Chimera's, the King laid a real Deſign to make himſelf once more Maſter of the <hi>Franche Compte,</hi> thereby to cover his Frontiers, which lay almoſt expoſed on that ſide, to encourage his Subjects by ſome great Enterprize, and to make his Enemies ſenſible, that he was in a condition not only to defend himſelf, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to act offenſively againſt them. When the <hi>State</hi> is threatned by ſome great and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, it muſt needs be oppreſs'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of it, unleſs the Prince do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and cheriſh his Subjects by his good Conduct and firm Reſolution; for if the Head prove defective, the Functions of the whole Body begin to ceaſe.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Spaniards</hi> declared War againſt us, the King propoſed a Neutrality for that Province, and the <hi>Swiſs Cantons</hi> did all what in them lay to ſecond the King's Endeavours, as being unwilling to ſee a Province border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo near upon them to become the Seat of War; but the Allies refuſed to accept the King's offer, which in lieu of proving advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95697:78"/>to them cauſed the loſs of it, or at leaſt facilitated the King's Conqueſts there; the <hi>Cantons</hi> being exaſperated at their refuſal, having not only given their Conſent for the King to attempt the Reduction of it, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo denied a Paſſage to thoſe Troops that were intended for its relief. This was the only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle the King had to ſurmount, or at leaſt the moſt difficult; for tho the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſince the Concluſion of the Peace of <hi>Aix la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle,</hi> had re-fortified moſt of their Places, yet it was look'd upon as a much harder task to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe a Free People to give their conſent that a Potent and Victorious King ſhould ſettle himſelf in their Neighbourhood, than to conquer two or three ſtrong Holds, that were without hopes of relief.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the King ordred his Troops to march into the <hi>Franche Compte,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conquest of the</hi> Franche Compte.</note> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in the Month of <hi>February</hi> made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Veſoul,</hi> beſides many other ſmall Places. But this being only the beginning of the Fray, the reſt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the King's coming in Perſon.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſancon.</note> the King came himſelf into the Camp, his Preſence being abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there, to qualifie the Minds of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who were forced to undergo incredible Hardſhips in this Siege. It was extream bad Weather when the Court ſet out for the <hi>Camp,</hi> and grew almoſt inſupportable ſoon after, which continued thus to the end of the Siege. The great Rains that fell without intermiſſion, the high Winds and cold Nights, the Waters that overflowed the Trenches, and the whole
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95697:78"/>Camp, where the Soldiers ſtood Knee deep in Mud and Dirt; all theſe Fatigues would que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs have tired out the Patience of the Soldiers, if the King who expoſed his Perſon to the ſame Hardſhips had not by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Liberality upheld their drooping Courage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beſancon</hi> is ſituate in a ſmall Plain upon a very ill Ground, ſo rocky and full of Stones, that we had much ado to carry on our Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. It is divided into the higher and lower Town, the laſt is ſurrounded by the River <hi>Doux,</hi> which ſerves for a Ditch, and being at that time overflown by the frequent Rains, did extreamly annoy us in the carrying on of our Trenches. The place was provided with a Garriſon of four Thouſand Men, one half being of the Militia, beſides a good number of Volunteers, all under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of an Old and Brave Officer. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, they made but a ſlender Defence, the Citadel it ſelf which was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impregnable, not being able to hold out above eight Days. This Citadel was newly fortified on the very point of a Rock very near perpendicular on all ſides, having no more than one Avenue leading to the top, which was well fortified with ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, ſtrengthned with Baſtions and Half-Moons.</p>
            <p>The place however had this diſadvantage belonging to it, that it was commanded by two adjacent Rocky Hills, but of ſo ſteep and difficult an Aſcent, that in all humane appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it was impoſſible to bring any Cannon to the tops of them. As they lay on the back
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95697:79"/>ſide of the Citadel and within full reach of the Cannon, the King went in Perſon to view them. The Attempt ſeem'd to be the boldeſt and moſt dangerous that ever was undertaken, but Nature having not framed any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible to the Couragious, the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, That all the Night long, by the light of a great number of Torches and Links, they ſhould draw up the Cannon to the top of one of theſe Hills, and he did not ſtir from thence till he ſaw it put in execution. The Beſieged ſurprized at the boldneſs of the Enterprize, however ply'd them warmly with their Cannon; but in ſpite of their Fire, which play'd without intermiſſion, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their Work, and raiſed a Battery which the next following Day began to play againſt the Citadel.</p>
            <p>The inſide being all built of Stone, the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Bullets made a moſt terrible havock in a Fort which was of no great compaſs, ſo that you might ſee at every moment the Stones fly about as thick as Hail, which did great exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution among the Garriſon, many of whom were ſlain by the Stones, the reſt not daring to appear but in the Night time. Thus the Out-Works being taken in a few Days, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was forced to Capitulate.</p>
            <p>After the taking of <hi>Beſancon,</hi> the King laid Siege to <hi>Dole,</hi> the Fortifications of which place being not quite brought to perfection, it did hold out not above nine Days. <hi>Salins</hi> defended it ſelf ſeven Days, and the ſtrong Caſtle of St. <hi>Anne,</hi> which was hitherto eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inacceſſible, beat a Parly as ſoon as a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery erected upon vaſt Wooden-Piles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95697:79"/>to thunder againſt it. Thus the King conquered the whole <hi>Franche Compte</hi> in four or five Weeks.</p>
            <p>After the Conqueſt of this Province, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his Army, one part being ſent into <hi>Germany</hi> to reinforce the Viſcount of <hi>Turenne;</hi> and the greateſt part into <hi>Flanders</hi> to joyn the Army commanded by the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> Then he returned into <hi>France,</hi> to ſuppreſs by his Preſence ſome Cabals, which it was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected had been ſet on foot by the Allies in ſome of the Maritime Provinces. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was at that time threatned on all ſides; it was in no ſmall danger of being Invaded on the <hi>German</hi> ſide: The Allies had three Armies in the Field in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> another in <hi>Catalonia;</hi> and to make ſure Work, the <hi>Dutch</hi> threatned either to make a Deſcent upon us, or at leaſt to Bombard ſome of our Seaport-Towns. But all theſe vaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns vaniſhed into Smoak; for our Frontiers remained unattempted all this Campaign, and the King had taken ſuch ſure Meaſures, that the Allies had nothing elſe to boaſt of, but of their own Diſgrace, having been defeated by the King's Troops much inferiour in number to theirs.</p>
            <p>They were no leſs than threeſcore Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand effective Men in <hi>Flanders,</hi> all ſelect and old well-diſciplin'd Troops; whereas the King's Army commanded by the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Battle of</hi> Seneff.</note> did conſiſt only of forty Thouſand Men. The Enemy advanced towards him, but he was ſo advantageouſly poſted, that they did not judge it adviſable to attack him; thus failing in their aim, they decamped. The
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95697:80"/>
               <hi>Germans</hi> cammanded by the General <hi>de Souches</hi> had the Van-guard; the main Battle was made up out of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces under the Command of the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> Commanded by the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> had the Inner Guard, being covered in their March by a Body of five Thouſand Horſe, detach'd from the ſeveral Bodies of the three Nations. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was adviſed that in their March they were obliged to paſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Lanes, judged not without reaſon, that as they paſs'd through theſe Defiles, they muſt march at ſuch a diſtance, as not to be able to ſecond one another timely enough, in caſe of an Attack. Looking therefore upon it as a moſt favourable opportunity to fall in with them, he was reſolved not to let it ſlip out of his Hands.</p>
            <p>Having therefore ſuffered the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> to paſs the Defiles unmoleſted, he charged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo furiouſly, that he abſolutely routed them, taking many Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and Colours, and a great many Priſoners, among whom were ſeveral of Quality. This firſt Victory did not coſt the King above an Hundred, or an Hundred and fifty Men, whereas the Enemy loſt above three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; a happy Days Work, if the Prince could have been contented with his good Succeſs! But having afterwards Attack'd the main Body, and likewiſe brought them in Confuſion, matters ſeem'd to tend to a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Rout, if the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had not found means to come to their relief. The Flying Enemy having got leiſure in the mean while
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95697:80"/>to Rally, and the three Generals to put their ſeveral Bodies in order of Battel, upon an Eminency, being cover'd with Buſhes, Hedges and Ditches, and Cannon planted on all the Avenues, the face of Affairs began to change, and the Fight was renewed with more obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and fury than before. The Enemies were poſted in ſuch a manner, that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come to Handy Blows with them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuſtaining the Fire of their whole Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but the greater the Danger, the greater the Honour; all this it ſeems was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſtartle the Invincible Courage of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> nor to terrifie his Soldiers fluſh'd with Succeſs, but being reſolved to compleat this Days Work by a third Victory, they fell on with incredible Bravery. As De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair is the moſt powerful Motive to inſpire Courage even in the Faint-hearted, ſo the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy defended themſelves with great Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; the Engagement laſted from Noon till Night, and the Slaughter did not ceaſe on both ſides, till Moon-light about Ten or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Clock at Night. The Enemy took few of ours Priſoners, and among them ſcarce any Body of note; but we loſt abundance of brave Men and Officers, ſeven or eight Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and had about five or ſix Thouſand kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and wounded. The loſs of the Enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to above ſeven or eight Thouſand; we took near five Thouſand Priſoners, among whom were four Princes of the Empire, a great number of other Perſons of Quality, many of their Colonels, and two Hundred Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; an Hundred and ſeven Standards and Colours, three Field-pieces, two Mortars,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95697:81"/>ſeveral Kettle-Drums, Pontons, three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Waggons, with all their Ammunition, and three hundred Thouſand Crowns in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money, deſign'd for the Payment of their Armies.</p>
            <p>About a Month after,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Oude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde.</note> they laid Siege to <hi>Oudenarde,</hi> but no ſooner had they got notice that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was marching to its relief, but they quitted the Siege with ſo much Precipitation, that they left behind them in their Trenches part of their Baggage and Ammunition, beſides moſt of their Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils uſed in carrying on of the Trenches.</p>
            <p>Another Army compoſed of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Grave.</note> and joyn'd by ſome <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Troops, were for two Months together buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Siege of <hi>Grave.</hi> The City of <hi>Grave</hi> is conſiderable for its ſtrength, and was at that time very well provided with Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a good Artillery, and a numerous Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon; but the Beſiegers being ſurrounded on all ſides by their own Country, had great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every thing in their Camp, and the place being but ſmall, there was little appearance it ſhould hold out long, the Place being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over for loſt by the <hi>French,</hi> without the leaſt hopes of being able to relieve it. The <hi>Dutch</hi> had made many Attacks upon their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, but with ſo little ſucceſs, that they were repulſed without being able to maintain themſelves in any of theſe Poſts. The Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed made continual Sallies, nail'd up their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, fill'd up their Trenches, kill'd abundance of their Men, and carried a great many Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners into the Town. Their bravery and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in undergoing with undaunted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95697:81"/>all the Fatigues of War, the continual thundring of their Cannon, and their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Mines, which, for the moſt part, did great execution, had ſtruck ſuch a terror a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Beſiegers, that they Deſerted by whole Troops, and got into the Town.</p>
            <p>To revive in ſome meaſure, the drooping Courage of the reſt, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> marched to their aſſiſtance with a Body of ten thouſand freſh Men, who being alſo repulſed in ſeveral Attacks, it was the general Opinion that the <hi>Dutch,</hi> would in all likelihood have been forced to quit the Enterpriſe, if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, the Marquiſs of <hi>Chamilly,</hi> had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Orders from our King to Capitulate, who, after he had given a thouſand Proofs of his Conduct and Courage, ſurrendred upon ſuch Conditions as he himſelf thought fit to propoſe; the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> being willing enough to grant him any thing, partly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his Bravery, partly for fear, leſt the Siege, by the obſtinate Defence of the Beſieged, ſhould protract, till Winter, when the Seaſon would oblige them to raiſe it. The Garriſon was extreamly diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not ſo much by the Enemies Swords as by Sickneſs; and tho' they were ſtreightned for Proviſions, yet were they reſolved to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured all the extremities, and bury them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Ruins of the Place, if the King, who would not ſuffer that ſo many brave Men ſhould Sacrifice themſelves for the defence of a Place, which he judged of no great conſequence to his Affairs, had not ſent them his Orders to Capitulate. The King had, at the beginning of the War, made himſelf
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95697:82"/>Maſter of this Place without the loſs of one ſingle Man, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> did not take it till after a Siege of three Months, with a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Charge, and the loſs of twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men; beſides, they run no ſmall hazard of coming off with diſgrace.</p>
            <p>But they were leſs ſucceſsful in their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at Sea this Year; they had near an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Men of War, and after the Peace with <hi>England,</hi> were become abſolute Maſters of the Ocean, the King having ſent moſt of his great Ships into the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> One part of this great Fleet was ſent to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Conqueſt of the <hi>French</hi> Plantations in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the reſt were to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in making a Deſcent upon our Coaſt; but the beſt concerted meaſures prove not always infallible.</p>
            <p>For Admiral <hi>Ruiter</hi> did not ſucceed in his Enterpriſe againſt the Iſle of <hi>Martinico,</hi> and Admiral <hi>Trump,</hi> who for four or five Months threatned our Coaſts with a deſent, did no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feats, but to Land in a ſmall Iſland, from whence he carried away ſome Cattel, and plunder'd a certain Abby. The ill ſucceſs of the Allies in this Campaign ſeem'd to be very ill preſages to the League, eſpecially if it be taken into conſideration, that the King's Arms were Crown'd with the ſame ſucceſs in ſeveral other places; for <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi> had beaten the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Plains of <hi>Ruſſilion;</hi> as the Vicount of <hi>Turenne</hi> had been Victorious over the <hi>Germans</hi> in three or four ſeveral Encounters.</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:95697:82"/>
            <p>For, after he had prevented the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> from paſſing the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſecur'd the King's Conqueſts on that ſide, he receiv'd Orders to hinder, if poſſible, the conjunction of the Duke with a Body of <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> commanded by the <hi>Imperial</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral the Count of <hi>Caprara.</hi> Purſuant to theſe Orders he marched three Days and Nights without intermiſſion, and on the fourth came within ſight of the Enemy, whom he found ſo advantageouſly poſted, that it ſeem'd impoſſible to attack them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the greateſt hazard in the World. For they were drawn up in order of Battle upon a riſing Ground, being ſecured in the Front by a ſmall Town, with a deep Rivulet, and many Hedges and Ditches, all which muſt be paſs'd before they could be attack'd. But what is ſo ſtrong or inacceſſible to a Man who has an equal ſhare of Conduct and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage?</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, the Town was taken in leſs than two Hours, and the Enemies Infantry which defended it, either cut in pieces, or taken Priſoners. But this was only the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the reſt; our Troops were extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fatigued with ſo long a March, and the heat of the Seaſon; beſides that, the Enemy having the advantage of the Wind, they were incommoded with the Smoak and Duſt which almoſt choak'd them as they advanc'd towards the Enemy, where the Enemy ſtood ready to receive them: Notwithſtanding all theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages, they were reſolute in attacking them; the Viſcount of <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Army conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of nine or ten thouſand Men, and that of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95697:83"/>the Duke of <hi>Loerain</hi> was near equal in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to his, with this difference only, that the laſt had more Horſe, the other exceeded in Foot. The firſt attack was made with equal bravery on both ſides, there being not a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron but what charged four or five times, and the Dukes Forces rallied and return'd to their charge ſeven or eight times, neither were they put to the rout till after a bloody and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Fight of eight Hours.</p>
            <p>About three Weeks after, the Prince of <hi>Bourneville</hi> General of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Forces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Body of ſeven or eight thouſand Men joyn'd to the broken remainders of the Confederate Army.
<note place="margin">July 6th.</note> The Viſcount of <hi>Turenne</hi> paſſed the River <hi>Neckar</hi> at <hi>Ladenburgh,</hi> in ſight of them, and followed them ſo cloſely, that he fell in with their Rear, which he put to the rout, forcing their Infantry to ſeek for ſhelter among the neighbouring Woods and Mountains; but their Horſe being briskly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the <hi>French,</hi> did not face about till they came to <hi>Franckfort,</hi> twenty Leagues from thence, where being cover'd by the River <hi>Maine,</hi> the Viſcount could not purſue them any further; but they were ſcatter'd to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that they were not in a condition to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear again in the Field, till being reinforced with freſh Supplies and Troops from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, from the Elector <hi>Palatin,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Munster,</hi> Duke of <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenbuttel,</hi> and all the neighbouring Circles, they made up an Army of thirty five or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix thouſand Effiective Men.</p>
            <p>But this great Body was commanded by five Generals independant from one another, who
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95697:83"/>being ſwayed by ſo many different Intereſts, did not agree in what meaſures to take; one being for the attempting the recovery of the Dukedom of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> another for the Siege of <hi>Treves</hi> or <hi>Philipsburgh;</hi> another for attacking the Viſcount of <hi>Turenne</hi> with their joynt Forces, thereby to retrieve their former diſgrace. The <hi>French</hi> Army was at that time not above fifteen thouſand ſtrong, but the renown of their General, and their late Victories had made them ſo dreadful to the Enemy, that they durſt not attempt to attack them.</p>
            <p>With this ſmall Army he kept them in play for two Months together in the Lower-<hi>Alſace,</hi> till having at laſt receiv'd a reinforcement of ſome Regiments, he march'd directly againſt the Allies to give them Battle, before they could be joyn'd by the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>'s Forces, and thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick.</hi> The Name of the Viſcount of <hi>Turenne</hi> famous by ſo many Victories, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo terrible to the Enemy, that moſt were of opinion they would ſcarce care to face him, but beyond all expectation they receiv'd him with all imaginable bravery, ſo that the fight was very obſtinate and dubious for ſome time, till at laſt,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Victory of</hi> Entſheim, Octob. 4.</note> having brought them into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they were forc'd to quit the Field with the loſs of three thouſand Men, ten pieces of Cannon, and thirty Colours and Standards. The <hi>French</hi> were ſo eager in the purſuit, that the Enemies, to fly with the more convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, threw away their Cuiraſſes and Arms, of which there was a great quantity found all round about the Field of Battel.</p>
            <pb n="126" facs="tcp:95697:84"/>
            <p>This Action, as brave as it was, yet was not the moſt glorious of this Campaign: For the Allies having been joyn'd by the Troops of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> and <hi>Brunſwick Zell,</hi> about the middle of <hi>October,</hi> were near threeſcore and ten Thouſand ſtrong in the Field; an Army ſo numerous, it was fear'd, would like a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge over-run all our Conqueſts on that ſide, but that the King, with an incredible reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, without being in the leaſt ſurprized at their number, knew by his Prudence ſo to manage the Matter, that all their Deſigns turn'd to their own diſgrace.</p>
            <p>For immediately after the raiſing of the Siege of <hi>Oudenarde,</hi> he had ordred a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Detachment from <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> to join with all poſſible ſpeed the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Turenne;</hi> at the ſame time he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd his Orders to him, to keep upon the Defenſive, and as much as poſſibly could be, to provide for the ſecurity of thoſe Places, which were of moſt conſequence.</p>
            <p>The King wiſely foreſaw that this vaſt Multitude would ſoon be forced to diſperſe, by reaſon of the Diviſions that were among the Generals, for want of ſufficient Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines, and the Incommodities of the Seaſon, which muſt needs occaſion many Diſeaſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Souldiers; or that at laſt whenever they ſhould come to ſeparate themſelves, there could not be wanting an opportunity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and vanquiſh them. Accordingly the Viſcount of <hi>Turenne</hi> quitted his Camp to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a certain Port ſo convenient and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for its ſituation, that with his ſmall Army he conquered both <hi>Haugenan</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne.</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:95697:84"/>The Allies, who did not judge it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable to attack him in this advantageous Poſt, marched directly into the <hi>Upper Alſace,</hi> with an intention to take up their Winter-Quarters in this Province, and ſo to march in the Spring directly either into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> or the <hi>Franche Compte;</hi> thus they lived at diſcretion for the ſpace of two Months, over ſecure in their own ſtrength, till the Viſcount of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> beat up their Quarters, and ſent them back to the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After he had received the abovementioned Reinforcement from <hi>Flanders,</hi> his Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of ſcarce five and twenty Thouſand Men; and tho he was ſufficiently informed of the ſtrength of the Allies, who had near three to one againſt him, he marched in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> taking a great compaſs about, as if he were retiring from before them, and ſhunning to come to an Engagement.

            <p>All theſe Victories as they were the happy Products of the King's Vigilancy,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Campaign of</hi> 1675.</note> and the Bravery of his Soldiers, ſo they ſtruck ſuch a Terrour among his Enemies, that they were reſolved to try their utmoſt, the next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Campaign. The King finding their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations ſuitable to their Deſigns, ſet out ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Spring for the Army, and having ordred the Seige of <hi>Dinant</hi> and <hi>Huy</hi> after the Reduction of theſe two Places, the firſt by the Marſhal de <hi>Crequy,</hi> the ſecond by <hi>Henry Lewis Dalenny de Rochfort,</hi> likewiſe Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> the City of <hi>Limburgh,</hi> famous for its ſtrength, and being the Capital of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the ſame Name, was immediately Beſieged by <hi>Henry Julius</hi> Duke of <hi>Enguen,</hi> ſince Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> which was forced to ſurrender within eight Days after.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> in conjunction with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> marched to its Relief with an Army
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95697:85"/>conſiſting of fifty Thouſand effective Men, but finding at their approach, that the place was ſurrendred, they retreated without doing any thing further that Campaign, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all the Forage in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and to ruine their own Territories.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Germany</hi> was the Theater of War, where the moſt glorious Actions were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed during this Campaign, Fortuneſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep an equal Balance betwixt Us and the Allies on that ſide. The Enemies Army upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> appearing more numerous in the Field than it had done any time ſince the beginning of this War. The laſt Campaign there had been ſo many Factions as there were Generals among them, that, to ſpeak impartially, they were without a Head to Command them.</p>
            <p>But now things appear'd with quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Face, the whole Army being Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Count of <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> the ſame who two Years before had the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Imperial Army</hi> upon the <hi>Rhine.</hi> He was an old and experienced General, very well verſed in the whole Art, and all the Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems of War, always upon his Guard, whoſe Ambition was, not ſo much to gain any particular advantage upon his Enemy, as to bring a whole Campaign to a happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
            <p>The Viſcount of <hi>Turenne;</hi> General of the King's Army on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> was not inferiour to him either in Experience, or any other Qualification belonging to a Great General; and it may be ſaid without Flattery, that his Name was more famous, and his Reputation
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95697:86"/>better eſtabliſhed by an infinite number of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Actions, in all which he had given moſt ample demonſtrations to the World, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any General was comparable to, or at leaſt never ſurpaſſed him in the Art of War. Among the moſt Renowned Heroes in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, who by their great Actions and Conqueſts have rendred their Names ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to Poſterity, there are few who can boaſt of the ſame Skill wherewith this Great General uſed to Diſcipline his Troops, to provide them with all Neceſſaries, and to make uſe of all Advantages to thwart the Deſigns of his Enemies.</p>
            <p>It was without all queſtion a thing worth the notice and attention of all <hi>Europe,</hi> to ſee theſe two great Captains to uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to outvie one another in their ſwift Marches, in their Encampments, and to make uſe of all the moſt refined Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, to prevent one another from gair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt advantage. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had nevertheleſs the good Fortune to paſs the <hi>Rhine</hi> almoſt in ſight of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Army,</hi> which done, he poſſeſs'd himſelf of ſo advantageous a Poſt, that without the leaſt fear of being forced in his Entrenchments, he might cut off the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Convoys from the Enemy.</p>
            <p>An Action ſo Glorious which had broken all the Meaſures of his Rival at one ſtroke, was look'd upon by all <hi>Europe</hi> to be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to a Victory. But the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> not ſatisfied with this Advantage, unleſs he had alſo routed the <hi>Confederate Army,</hi> had encloſed them ſo narrowly on all ſides, that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95697:86"/>it was impoſſible for them to march off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coming to handy Blows.</p>
            <p>In order to this he went out of his Camp on the 27th of <hi>July</hi> to view a certain place, where he intended to raiſe a Battery the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to annoy the Enemy, where he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately ſlain by a Cannon-ſhot,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Death of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi> de Turenne.</note> which ſtruck againſt his Breaſt, and laid him dead, upon the Ground.</p>
            <p>Never was any General more univerſally lamented, neither did ever any one deſerve it better. He was a Perſon of extraordinary Merit, a Great Captain and excellent Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; a Man equally modeſt and agreeable in Converſation, who deſpiſed Riches, and was an Enemy to Pride, who was never backward in doing all the good he could, and never known to do harm to any Body, all his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being directed to glorious Actions. It is not to be expreſs'd how ſenſibly the King was touch'd with the loſs of ſo great a Man, he heap'd Honours and Riches upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
<note place="margin">The Viſcount dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> and to give the moſt ample Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Value he put upon his paſs'd Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and to Crown the Vertues of ſo great a Man with due Rewards, he cauſed moſt magnificent Obſequies to be made in the Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> and order'd his Corps to be depoſited in the Abbey of St. <hi>Denys,</hi> the ordinary Burying place of the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> But the greateſt ornament of the whole Funeral Pomp was the inexpreſſible ſorrow which appear'd in the Countenance of all the Chief Men of the Kingdom, and the everlaſting Memory of his great and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Actions.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:95697:87"/>
            <p>But to return to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having not communicated his deſign to any of his Lieutenant-Generals, the Count <hi>de Lorge,</hi> his Nephew, afterwards made Duke, Peer and Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> took upon him the Command of the Army, and immediately after his Death repaſs'd the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and intrench'd himſelf on the other ſide, till further Orders from the King. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my during his Retreat, Attack'd him in the Rear, but were ſo vigorouſly received by the <hi>French,</hi> that they loſt above four thouſand Men upon this occaſion; nevertheleſs the Count <hi>de Lorge</hi> was not ſtrong enough to prevent <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecuculi</hi> from paſſing the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and marching into the <hi>Lower Alſace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Army was at that time in a very ill Condition, in want of Proviſion and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, much diminiſh'd by Sickneſs and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and ſo dejected by the loſs of their General, that it was feared they would have been quite diſperſed, if the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who by the King's Orders poſted in all haſte thither from <hi>Flanders,</hi> had not found means to raiſe their drooping Courage by his Preſence. Notwithſtanding which the Count of <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuculi</hi> laid Siege to the City of <hi>Hagenau</hi> in <hi>August,</hi> and in the Month of <hi>September</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing fat down before <hi>Saverne,</hi> but upon intelligence that the Prince was marching to their Relief, he quitted both theſe Enterprizes. At laſt towards the latter end of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> were obliged to repaſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and to take up their Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Confederate Territories.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:95697:87"/>
            <p>But the Dukes of <hi>Zell</hi> and <hi>Lorrain</hi> had much better Succeſs in the Siege of <hi>Treves.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Treves.</note> For theſe Princes being advertized that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de Crequy,</hi> at the Head of an Army, was marching to the Relief of the Place, left a good Body for the guard of their Trenches, and other Works, and march'd with a Body of near twenty Thouſand Men to meet the Enemy. The Marſhal had not above nine or ten Thouſand Men with him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this inequality of their Number, he reſolved to try his Fortune. There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain happy Moments, when we have known a handful of brave reſolute Fellows to have driven before them, and cut in pieces a whole Army, but theſe Fortunate Moments are ſo rare, that it is more expedient to relie upon the number and equality of our Troops, than upon theſe Accidents.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Defeat of the Marſhal</hi> de Crequy</note> this Day proved unfortunate to the Marſhal <hi>de Crequy;</hi> for his Infantry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill ſeconded by the Cavalry, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely defeated, and his ſmall Army put to the Rout, and diſperſed in ſuch a manner, that he himſelf, with only three more, was forced to ſhelter themſelves in an adjacent Wood, from whence he found means to get into <hi>Treves.</hi> He defended the place for three Weeks after with incredible Bravery againſt his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Enemy, and would not-hearken to any Propoſitions of Surrender, tho all the Out-works were taken, and that there were ſeveral large Breaches in the Walls of the Place. The Garriſon headed by ſome muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Officers, were ſo exaſperated at this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Reſolution, that they reſolved to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95697:88"/>without him, and accordingly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred him, and many other of the <hi>French</hi> Officers to the Allies.</p>
            <p>This being the firſt Campaign which ſince the beginning of this War had proved pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous to the <hi>Confederates,</hi> they were ſo puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up with their late Succeſs, that forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their former Misfortunes, and the many Advantages we had over them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to boaſt, that in the next Spring they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to put their ſo long projected great deſign in execution.</p>
            <p>But it was not long, before the King made them ſufficiently ſenſible, that by the loſs of a Place and four or five Thouſand Men, he was not become leſs powerful than before. For after having Beſieged and Taken the City of <hi>Conde</hi> by aſſault,
<note place="margin">Conde <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> April <hi>the</hi> 26th.</note> towards the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> he ordred the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Bouchain.</hi> whilſt he himſelf with the head Army covered the Siege to make head againſt the Enemy, in caſe they ſhould come to its relief. The Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> brought together a good Army, in order, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, to attempt the Relief of the Place; but judging it not adviſable to attack the King, they entrenched themſelves under the Cannon of <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> in hopes to meet with a favourable opportunity to throw ſome Supplies of Men and Proviſions into <hi>Bouchain,</hi> but they reap'd no other advantage by it, than to be Eye-Witneſſes of the Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Place. The King endeavoured by all means poſſible to bring them to a Battle, but they were as careful to avoid it, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

            <p>The City of <hi>Cambray</hi> is Situate at the very entrance of <hi>Flanders,</hi> where it joyn'd on our Frontiers, and was conſequently very incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to us, the Garriſon having often car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Fire and Flame into our Territories, as far as the <hi>Iſle of France,</hi> from whence they uſed to draw great Contributions, ſufficient to entertain a good number of Troops, who frequently play'd the Maſters over us in theſe parts, when for the reſt we gave Laws to all the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands.</hi> The Situation of St. <hi>Omer</hi> was ſuch, as to be in a condition to make frequent Excurſions into the Province of <hi>Artois,</hi> and the <hi>Boulonneſe</hi> Territories, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenciennes</hi> was of as great conſequence to us as the other two; but, tho' the King was not ignorant long before of the advantage of the Conqueſt of theſe three places, yet conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſtrength, we durſt ſcarce flatter our ſelves to be able to undertake ſuch an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to Beſiege them all three at once, or if we did, there appear'd but little likelihood of ſucceeding in ſo great an undertaking.</p>
            <p>There was in <hi>Valenciennes</hi> at that time,

The City was ſecured on one ſide by the Watery and boggy Grounds, on the other, by many large Out-Works, ſurrounded with deep Ditches full of Water. The Inhabitants over-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the ſtrength of the Place, and recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to their Memory the diſgrace which the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95697:91"/>Marſhal <hi>de la Ferte</hi> receiv'd before that Place in the Year 1656, were puff'd up with ſo much Vanity, that, when the King ſat down before the Place, in lieu of being alarm'd at it, they ſhew'd not the leaſt concern in the World, but paſs'd their time in Feaſting and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings, and gave Balls upon their Baſtions. But this Vain-Glory ſoon vaniſh'd, and it may be ſaid, without the leaſt contradiction to Truth, that there is ſcarce an Example to be found, where a place of ſuch ſtrength, and ſo much reputation, has made a more faint reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance than this.</p>
            <p>In the foregoing Year the King had made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Bouchain,</hi> one of which being ſituate above, the other below <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> he by poſting a good Body of Horſe near theſe two places, had kept this City block'd up thegreateſt part of the Winter.</p>
            <p>It was Inveſted on the firſt Day of <hi>March,</hi> and the King being arrived on the fourth of the ſame Month in the Camp, the Trenches were opened betwixt the eighth and ninth, and puſh'd on the ſame Night for above ſixteen hundred Paces. The chief Attack was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on againſt a Crown-Work, containing within its compaſs a half Moon, and behind that a Ravelin, call'd the <hi>Paſty.</hi> Our Cannon and Bombs had done great Execution upon theſe Out-Works for ſeveral Days together, when it was reſolv'd to give the Aſſault on the next Morning by eight a Clock. The Troops Commanded to give the Aſſault fell like Lions in four ſeveral places upon the Counterſcarp with ſo much fury, that the Enemy not being able to ſuſtain them, firſt gave way, and ſoon
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95697:92"/>after betook themſelves to flight. Being purſued by the <hi>French,</hi> they retreated into the Crown-Work, but with ſo much preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation, that our Men enter'd pell mell with them, and attacking them in Front, Rear, and Flank, cut eight hundred of them in pieces; the reſt, who endeavour'd to ſave themſelves by flight, were beaten from Poſt to Poſt with ſuch an incredible Courage, that being quite frighted out of their ſenſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they neglected to draw up the Bridge which joyn'd to the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work. The Conquering Soldiers encourag'd as much by the opportunity as the good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, make themſelves Maſters of the Bridge, and whilſt the reſt are buſie in breaking open the Gates with Hatchets, ſome got upon the top of the next Baſtion by the help of Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, turn the Cannon againſt the Town, whilſt their Comerades that were got in thro' the Gates marched into the City, and barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado'd themſelves in the great Street, in ſight of the Garriſon, and the City Militia, who being ſtruck with a Panick fear at the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Enterprize,

               </note> threw down their Arms, and without any further Capitulation, ſurrender'd at Diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Who is ſo ignorant as not to be ſenſible what prodigious Diſorders uſed to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ranſacking of a Town taken by Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, when the enraged Soldier makes the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, without the leaſt difference of Age, Quality, or Sex, feel the effects of his Fury. The dreadful Idea of all theſe Diſaſters, their late unſeaſonable Bravadoes, and that impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable hatred which they had ſhewn againſt the <hi>French</hi> upon many occaſions, made the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95697:92"/>Inhabitants, not without great reaſon, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the ſight of their Conquering Enemies. But it was not long that they were in fear of becoming a prey and Victim to the <hi>French</hi> Soldiers, a few Minutes having deliver'd them from theſe direful apprehenſions; for, no ſooner had the King been advertiſed of what had paſſed, but he ſent Meſſenger after Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, to forbid the plundering of the City.</p>
            <p>The Soldiers had already began with ſome of the adjacent Houſes, five or ſix had been forced to feel the effects of thoſe misfortunes which happen in the pillaging of a Place ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Aſſault; and 'twas fear'd that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Soldiers would ſcarce be prevail'd upon to let ſlip ſo fair an opportunity of ſatisfying both their Avarice and Revenge, and to be deaf to the Orders of their Commanders; but no ſooner were they forbidden in the King's Name to plunder the City, but all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ceaſed in an inſtant, to the great aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the whole City, who could not but ſtand amaz'd at the ſubmiſſion of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery in the midſt of their fury, who gave ſuch eminent marks of their Obedience to the King's pleaſure, by their alacrity in gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Victory, and their entire ſubmiſſion in relinquiſhing the Fruits of their Bravery. The whole Garriſon which conſiſted ſtill of two thouſand eight hundred Men, were made Priſoners of War; but the Citizens had their chiefeſt Privileges confirm'd to them. In the Afternoon every thing appear'd as quiet in the City, as if they had not chang'd their Maſter. A moſt remarkable Victory, where a handful of Men, in half an hours time,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95697:93"/>carried ſeveral ſtrong Works by Aſſault, paſſed four or five Ditches, and made themſelves Maſters of one of the ſtrongeſt and moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Cities in all <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that with the loſs only of Forty Men on our ſide.</p>
            <p>The taking of <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> did, like a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thunderclap, make the whole Country round about tremble for fear, there being ſcarce one City, tho' never ſo ſtrong, in thoſe parts, which did not dread to undergo the ſame Fate. To raiſe their drooping Courage, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> march'd at the Head of an Army of thirty thouſand Men, compoſed of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces, to endeavour the relief either of <hi>Cambray,</hi> or St. <hi>Omer,</hi> which were beſieg'd both at the ſame time, the firſt by the King in Perſon, the other by the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> his Majeſty's only Brother. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi> being of ſuch a ſtrength and advantageous Situation, that it was reported, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made more account upon it than all the reſt of <hi>Flanders;</hi> it was generally believ'd the ſtorm would fall that way, but beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Enemy rather choſe to relieve St. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> than <hi>Cambray,</hi> partly becauſe they might with leſs difficulty poſſeſs themſelves of ſome advantageous Poſts near St. <hi>Omer,</hi> partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had flatter'd themſelves with this Opinion, that without much reſiſtance they might force our Quarters on one ſide, where they were not very well ſecur'd.</p>
            <p>The Enemies march was ſo far from cauſing the leaſt diſturbance among our Soldiers, that both Sieges were carried on with the ſame Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour as before, there being ſuch an Emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among the Soldiery, that one ſtrove to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95697:93"/>the other in performing their duties, the more, becauſe they were plentifully provided with every thing neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence. For it is to be obſerv'd, that the King took al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways this ſure Maxim, to have his Magazins every Year very well provided during the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with all manner of Proviſions, to be in a condition to prevent his Enemies deſigns, and to appear as early in the Field as he judg'd it convenient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cambray</hi> was ſo furiouſly attack'd by the King,
<note place="margin">Cambray <hi>ſurrender'd</hi> April 5.</note> that the City was forc'd to Capitulate within ſix days after opening of the Trenches; the next following Day the King order'd a Detachment of nine Battallions to march with all poſſible diligence to joyn the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> before the Enemy could force his Lines, or engage him. This Prince had in the mean while advanc'd ſo briskly in the Siege of St. <hi>Omer,</hi> that at that very time he had made himſelf Maſter of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Fort near the Place, and on which depended hitherto the whole ſafety of the Town. It was at that very inſtant he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved certain intelligence that the Enemy were advanced within ſix or ſeven Leagues, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to relieve the Place. His Troops were much haraſs'd, and leſs numerous than the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s, but having receiv'd the King's Orders to march againſt them, he marched out of the Lines, and having left only a Body of Militia, with ſome regular Troops, to guard the Trenches and Works, directed his march towards <hi>Caſſel,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that the King had taken his meaſures ſo ſurely, as that the expected reinforcement
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95697:94"/>would come time enough to his aſſiſtance; neither did he find himſelf in the leaſt miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his hopes, the above-mention'd Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions having joyn'd him at the very nick of time, as he expected, and ſo a <hi>propos,</hi> that if they had come ſooner, they would have been leſs uſeful.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> ſtrengthen'd by this reinforcement, and finding himſelf not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in number to the Enemy, ſought only for an opportunity to execute the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; in order to which, with a generous reſolution, he paſſed the next Day with his Army a ſmall Brook which ſeparated the two Armies, and attack'd the Enemy with great fury.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Battli of</hi> Caſſel April 11.</note> The firſt Encounter was the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible that had been ſeen in the memory of Man, both ſides fighting with an equal brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo that the ſucceſs remain'd doubtful for ſome Hours, juſt as if Fortune had taken a particular delight to ſee ſo many brave Men diſpute Victory to the utmoſt of their power. But after the Enemy had ſtood their ground bravely for three Hours,, they were at laſt forc'd to give way, and ſoon after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken on all ſides, to ſeek for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their Heels; leaving as a pledge of their defeat, to the mercy of our Soldiers all their Ammunition and Baggage, ſeventeen Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, four and forty Colours, thirteen pieces of Cannon, three thouſand Priſoners, and the Field all cover'd with dead and wounded Men; Six thouſand of them were counted to be fallen upon the ſpot, the reſt ſav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the favour of the Hedges and Defiles; the approaching Night, and the vaſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95697:94"/>number of ſmall Channels, in which the Country abounds ſerving them for a ſafeguard againſt their Enemies, who durſt not purſue them but with a great deal of caution.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> acquir'd immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Glory in this Action, having ſhewn himſelf as great a General in the diſpoſition of his Army, as he behav'd himſelf a brave Soldier during the whole Engagement, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd two Shot in his Armour, as he was rallying ſome Battallions and leading them on again to Charge the Enemy; he continued with his Army for 2 Days after, near the Field of Battle, the better to give his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the purſuit of the Enemy, and to ſee whether perhaps they might be in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to try their Fortune, and attempt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Place a ſecond time; but having received certain intelligence that they were retreated far into the Country, he return'd with his Troops to the Lines, to continue the Siege of St. <hi>Omer</hi> without any further inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p>In two Days after his new Batteries began to Play againſt the Body of the Place, and the Trenches were carried on to the Glacis. The Counterſcarp being taken,

            <p>Three days before the Citadel of <hi>Cambray</hi> had likewiſe been forc'd to a Surrender by the King. The Garriſon was compoſed of ſeven old Regiments, whereof two were <hi>Spaniards,</hi> two <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> and three <hi>Walloons,</hi> under a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95697:95"/>Governor who had an equal ſhare of bravery and skill in Martial Affairs.

Every thing ſeem'd to concur for a Vigorous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the King's Forces, who were not above nine or ten thouſand ſtrong. This ſeem'd to be a very ſlender Force, and little ſuitable to the greatneſs of the Enterpriſe, but the King, by his Preſence, Vigilancy, and Example, did animate his Soldiers to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that redoubling their Courage and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity, they, in ſpite of the continual Fire and frequent Sallies of the Beſieged, carried all the Out-Works in nine or ten Days time. Our Cannon having ſoon after made a Breach in one of the Baſtions of the Place, large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for thirty Men to mount a-Breaſt, the Governour deſpairing of being able to hold out the Aſſault, demanded a Capitulation. It would have been no difficult matter for the King to have oblig'd him to ſurrender at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, but being free to ſhew Mercy to one that had behav'd himſelf ſo Gallantly,
<note place="margin">

            <p>The Conqueſt of theſe three important places, and the Battle of <hi>Caſſel,</hi> put the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Confederacy into ſuch a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that it was a conſiderable time before they could recollect themſelves.

There was no other remedy left, than either to fight us, or to quit the Siege, but the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates not judging it for their purpoſe to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a ſecond Battle, they decamped not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Confuſion before eight Days were expired, laying the fault upon one another, and conſuming what Forage they could meet with in the Country, without ſhewing any great inclination to oppoſe the King's Forces, who ravaged the Country, and exacted great Contributions.</p>

For it being the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of that Prince to keep in his Hands as long as poſſibly he could, that great power wherewith he was inveſted as long as he was ſupream Commander both over their Sea and Land Forces, he left no Stone unturn'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the States from making either a general or particular Peace with <hi>France.</hi> But this ſmall and troubleſome War, which had already laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed four Years, having exhauſted all the Parties concerned, both of Men and Money, the Prince judged it moſt for his Purpoſe to make his application to the Court of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> at that time overflow'd in Riches, they had in a manner managed all the Traffick of <hi>Europe</hi> alone for three Years laſt paſt. Their great affluence of Riches, had made them jealous of our King's growing Power, and being beſides this deſirous of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of ſignalizing themſelves abroad, they earneſtly wiſhed for a War with <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:95697:97"/>which had made them more than once to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite King <hi>Charles</hi> II. to enter into the Confederacy. This appearing a favourable juncture to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Deſign, he undertook a Journey to <hi>London,</hi> as well to engage that King in an Alliance againſt us, as to eſpouſe the eldeſt Daughter of the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> being K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. his Nephew, was much beloved and eſteemed by him. The Prince's Religion, his great Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Riches, his Averſion to <hi>France,</hi> and his great Intereſt in <hi>Holland,</hi> had procured him great and many Friends in both Houſes of Parliament. It is eaſie to be imagined, that upon this occaſion he made uſe of all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to draw his Uncle into the Confederacy, for which reaſon he perſwaded him to project certain Propoſitions of Peace, and to declare againſt thoſe that ſhould refuſe to accept of them.

               <hi>France</hi> being unwilling to hearken to theſe Conditions, great Levies were made in <hi>England,</hi> and ſome of their Troops were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported into <hi>Flanders.</hi> But neither this New League, neither the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Auxiliary Troops were ſufficient to ſtop the Progreſs of our King's Victorious Arms, or to hinder him from making new Conqueſts in the next Spring.</p>

<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Campaign in</hi> 1678.</note> he took a Progreſs into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the beginning of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> where he continued all that Month with the Queen and the whole Court.</p>
            <p>During this Progreſs, his Armies in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Lorrain</hi> were continually in motion, ſo that theſe Marches and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarches did amuſe the Enemy to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95697:98"/>that it was impoſſible for them to judge which of their Places was moſt in danger, and conſequently to take any ſure Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for the ſecurity of ſuch places as they thought moſt expoſed, for fear of leaving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unprovided in caſe of an Attack. For the King having his Magazines well provided with every thing neceſſary for the carrying on four or five <hi>Sieges</hi> at a time from the Sea to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the Confederates were put under a neceſſity of fearing all, without being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to gueſs whereabouts the Storm would fall.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they were under this perplexity, the Marſhal <hi>de Humiers</hi> made a faint, as if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Beſiege <hi>Ipres,</hi> which obliged the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> to ſend thither a great part of the Garriſon of <hi>Ghent.</hi> But ſcarce were they on their March towards <hi>Ipres,</hi> when the City of <hi>Ghent</hi> it ſelf was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted by threeſcore Thouſand Men, who were order'd thither from all the circumjacent pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and at the ſame time <hi>Ipres, Charlemont, Namur, Mons,</hi> and <hi>Luxenburgh,</hi> where the Confederates had diſpoſed moſt of their beſt Troops, were block'd up by ſeveral flying Armies.</p>

               <hi>Ghent</hi> has always been eſteemed the largeſt City of the Low Countries;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Ghent.</note> it has a good Citadel with very fair Out-works, a ſtrong Wall, ſurrounded with a large and deep Ditch. Its Fortifications, the number and Martial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of its Inhabitants, beſides its low ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in a Marſhy Ground, at the Confluence of three Rivers and two Canals, which ſerve for a Barricado againſt an approaching Enemy,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95697:98"/>did render this Enterpriſe ſo difficult in the Eyes of all the World, that after the Siege was begun, the News of it ſcarce met with credit in the Neighbouring Countries.</p>
            <p>The King had taken ſuch meaſures, and his Orders were obey'd with ſuch exactneſs and alacrity, that, tho' the Place had not been Inveſted above three Days when he arriv'd in the Camp, the Lines of Circumvallation, which contain'd eight Leagues in compaſs, were very near brought to perfection, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the rainy Seaſon, and the many difficulties which were to be ſurmounted in theſe marſhy Grounds. It was extreamly bad Weather when he ſet out from <hi>Stenay,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which he travelled above ſixty large Leagues in leſs than three Days, and arrived in the Camp before <hi>Ghent</hi> on the 4th of <hi>March,</hi> when without diſmounting from his Horſe, or taking the leaſt refreſhment or repoſe, he took, in Perſon, a view of the Place, and all the Works; the Governour of <hi>Ghent</hi> having the ſame Day open'd the Sluices, the King order'd ſo many Dikes and Ditches for the draining of the Ground to be made, that his Forces received no conſiderable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage by the Water, and were preſerv'd in ſo good a condition, as to make themſelves Maſters the next Day of the Counterſcarp, and ſome Out-Works. Nevertheleſs this great City defended it ſelf for ſome time lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, till the Inhabitants being made ſenſible of the effects of our Bombs, Carcaſſes, and fiery Bullets, which flew as thick as Hail-ſtones, and deſtroy'd their Houſes, they beat a Parley. The next day after the Citadel was beſieg'd by
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95697:99"/>Noon-day,
<note place="margin">Ghent <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
               </note> which being defended by four good Baſtions, and a Garriſon of a thouſand Men, yet was forc'd to ſurrender on the third Day after opening of the Trenches.</p>

               </note> the King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looſing any time marched directly to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,</hi> a well Fortified City, and conveniently ſituated for the King to keep correſpondence with, and ſecure his other Conqueſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had lately drawn out of the place two Battallions of their beſt Men, whom they ſent to <hi>Bruges</hi> to reinforce that Garriſon; nevertheleſs there was, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Siege, a Garriſon conſiſting of three thouſand effective Men, old and well diſciplin'd Troops; beſides a great number of brave Officers and Voluntiers, who, by their Example encouraged the Soldiers to make a vigorous Defence. But by the bravery of our Troops, the Trenches were carried on to the Glacis and Counterſcarp, and after a bloody En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement taken with Sword in Hand, ſo the City and Citadel being without any hopes of relief, Capitulated at the ſame time. The Siege coſt us abundance of Men, tho' it laſted not above nine Days after the opening of the Trenches, by reaſon that the <hi>French</hi> were not only to overcome the obſtinacy of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, who defended themſelves very valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo the rigour of the cold Seaſon, and the inconveniencies of continual Rains.</p>
            <p>The King's Arms being thus every where crown'd with Succeſs, it ſeem'd that nothing was able to reſiſt his Power; thoſe Princes that were enter'd into a League againſt him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for four Years together rais'd no other
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95697:99"/>advantage by the Confederacy, than to add new Luſtre to his Glory and Power: He had at that time two great Fleets at Sea, and five Armies on Land, which, together with his Garriſons, conſiſted of ſixty thouſand Horſe, and two hundred and forty thouſand Foot, all well diſciplin'd Troops, and inur'd to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of War. His Frontiers were enclos'd on all ſides with ſtrong Forts, and well For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd Cities; his Treaſury in a good condition, and the whole Kingdom in a profound Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. He himſelf both delighted in and underſtood the Art of War. His Affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſo flouriſhing a condition, what could hinder him from making new Conqueſts, if his deſire of Glory had not been Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balanc'd by his Inclination for Peace, and ſeeing that his Enemies were reduc'd to a ſtate of moderation, and his Frontiers ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on all ſides, he reſolved to reſtore tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>King</hi> Ch. II. <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at the Treaty of</hi> Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen.</note> his chief aim was, to make himſelf a happy inſtrument in procuring a general Peace, in which he ſucceeded ſo well, that his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was accepted. For hitherto matters had advanced but ſlowly at the Treaty of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> where two Years were ſpent in ſetling ſome Preliminaries of little moment, in reſpect of the great Work they were to tranſact; to wit, in Diſputes about the place of Treaty, in fixing the bounds of the Neutrality, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing their Credentials, and examining their Commiſſions, and ſuch other Prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as are commonly made uſe of to protract
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95697:100"/>theſe Conferences, whilſt in the mean while the longeſt Sword decides the principal diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in the Field.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficiently known, that ſcarce a Year had paſſed ſince the Declaration of the War, wherein <hi>Spain</hi> had not been a conſiderable lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, nevertheleſs, they were the firſt who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted with all the ſolemn expreſſions in the World, that they would never conſent to the Peace, unleſs our King did reſtore all what he had taken from them: and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Pretenſions were as exorbitant as thoſe of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For which purpoſe the King made his chief application to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> being ſenſible that if he could draw them from the Intereſt of the Confederacy, and perſwade them to accept of a ſeparate Peace, the other Princes would ſoon follow their Example. The King was ſufficiently convinc'd that the Jealouſy fomented by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Faction in <hi>Holland</hi> againſt the Prince, and their fear, leſt, if the War ſhould continue much longer, they might be involved in ſome troubles by the Prince's departure for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the decay of their Trade, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe charges they were at by bearing the burthen of the War in maintaining not only their own Troops, but alſo moſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Forces, made them very deſirous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Peace; but the more it was their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to promote it, the more difficulties were to be ſurmounted before it could be brought to a happy concluſion.</p>
            <p>For, tho' the Emperor and <hi>Spain</hi> had act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but with indifferent ſucceſs in this War, yet on the other Hand the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:95697:100"/>and Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> had had conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable advantages over <hi>Sueden,</hi> which had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for us againſt the Confederacy in the Year 1675. In three Years time that the War laſted betwixt the Northern Princes, the <hi>Suedes</hi> had gain'd three Battles by Land, but they had been worſted in three ſeveral Sea-Engagements, and had loſt the Iſle of <hi>Rugen,</hi> and all <hi>Pomerania.</hi> This ſucceſs againſt the <hi>Suedes</hi> ſeem'd to intimate to the Confederates, that the <hi>French</hi> might alſo be vanquiſh'd in their turn: The Emperor and <hi>Spain</hi> ſhew'd more inclination for the continuation of the War, than for the Peace, tho' it be evident, that their hopes were built but upon a very ſlippery foundation, to wit, upon the chance of Fortune, and thoſe continual viciſſitudes which are the conſtant Attendants of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Affairs.</p>
            <p>This was the reaſon, that notwithſtanding all the earneſt applications of the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to obtain a General Peace, yet the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty advanced but ſlowly, and might, perhaps, have been quite rendred ineffectual, if the King had not taken a firm reſolution to ſee it brought to a happy concluſion, by taking ſuch meaſures as ſhould oblige the reſt of the Confederates to accept of the Peace. The King himſelf drew up the Articles which he ſent to his Plenipotentiaries at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> to be communicated to the Mediators, under this condition, that in caſe the Confederates did not think fit to accept of them in forty Days, the King ſhould be at liberty to alter them, or to propoſe ſome new time. By vertue of theſe Articles, he was to remain in poſſeſſion of all
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95697:101"/>his Conqueſts, unleſs <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and ſix Places in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to wit, <hi>Ghent, Courtray, Aeth, Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denarde, Charleroy, Limbourgh,</hi> and St. <hi>Gillian</hi> demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>That the King promiſed to reſtore <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht</hi> to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and the ſix above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned places to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Peace of <hi>Munſter</hi> ſhould remain in its full force.</p>
            <p>That if the Emperour kept <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> the King ſhould remain in poſſeſſion of <hi>Fribourg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Prince of <hi>Furſtemberg</hi> ſhould be ſet at Liberty and reſtored to his Honour, Dignities, and Eſtate.</p>
            <p>And that laſtly, the Northern Princes ſhould reſtore to the <hi>Suedes</hi> what they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them in this War.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the Confederates exclaim'd againſt theſe Articles, but notwithſtanding all their Proteſtations and Clamours, their Threats, Intreagues, and Cabals, they were at laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to accept of the ſame terms.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> had no ſooner embrac'd the King's offer, but the Emperour and Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> loudly exclaim'd againſt their Proceedings, upbraiding them with breach of Faith, and Ingratitude. But who is ſo unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in publick Affairs, as to look for acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment among Princes, or to imagine they think themſelves oblig'd to one another for the aſſiſtance they give, when it is evident, that the ſame proceeds more from a motive of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt than Friendſhip? how can a State there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be charg'd with Ingratitude, unleſs it be call'd ſo when they ſearch too narrowly into the true cauſes of a benefit they have receiv'd?
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95697:101"/>But, to be ſhort, theſe reproaches made but ſlender impreſſions upon the States, who were ſo far from changing their opinion, that they prevail'd upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to follow their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; but when the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadours were upon the point of ſigning the Articles, there aroſe an unforeſeen difficulty, which was likely to have broken off the whole Treaty.</p>
            <p>For in the Article concerning <hi>Spain,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King had promiſed to reſtore to them ſix Places in <hi>Flanders,</hi> there being no certain time limitted, the <hi>States</hi> had interpreted it thus, that the Evacuation of the ſaid Places ſhould be made immediately after the Ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Peace betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> But the King's Intention being not ſo much that by reſtoring theſe Places to <hi>Spain,</hi> they ſhould ſerve as a Barricado betwixt him and the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> and to remove the Jealouſie they had conceived at the Neighbourhood of ſo potent a Prince, as to be in lieu of an equivalent for thoſe Places that were to be reſtored to <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> he refuſed to ſurrender theſe Cities into the Hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> before the <hi>Swedes</hi> had received full ſatisfaction as to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>This Spark was like to have proved the occaſion of rekindling the Flames, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the War with more Vigour and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſity than before, the Emperour and <hi>Spain</hi> not being wanting to lay hold of this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to revive the Jealouſies, and to perſwade the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that the King had no real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination for Peace, his only deſign being by withdrawing them from the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them hereafter with the more eaſe.</p>
            <pb n="162" facs="tcp:95697:102"/>
            <p>Our King had given moſt evident Proofs of his ſincere Intentions for the Peace; to promote which, he had recall'd his Forces out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Francis de Aubuſſon la Feuillade,</hi> Duke, Peer, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of <hi>France;</hi> he had at the Interceſſion of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> French <hi>leave</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily.</note> prolonged the Term which he had fixed to the Allies for the accepting the Propoſitions of Peace; and tho he had within the laſt Month extended his Conqueſts both in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> by the taking of two conſiderable places, yet was he ſo far from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any advantage of his good Fortune, that on the other hand he offered to reſtore them without any equivalent. But notwithſtanding all theſe Demonſtrations of his moſt fervent Inclinations for Peace, Matters hung in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe for ſome time, neither could the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be brought to a Concluſion, till the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> declared by his Ambaſſadors, <hi>That he not only conſented, but alſo prayed His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to reſtore the above mentioned Places to</hi> Spain, <hi>and not to delay any longer to give Peace to</hi> Europe, <hi>on account of the particular Interest of the Crown of</hi> Sweden. This grand Obſtacle being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Peace was ſigned betwixt the King and the States the 10th Day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the Year 1678.</p>
            <p>Within four Days after, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> attack'd the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> who, whilſt they were conteſting at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> kept <hi>Mons</hi> block'd up with an Army of forty Thouſand Men.

<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment near St.</hi> Denis.</note> but by his brave Reſolution he diverted the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that he had put himſelf into by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too confident of his own Security by the Peace.</p>
            <p>The Action was very bloody, which was ended at Night without any conſiderable Advantage on either ſide, unleſs that the Enemy retired in ſome Confuſion, and were purſued to their Camp. The next Day there was a Ceſſation of all Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Peace was proclaimed the ſame Day in the Camp, and ratified within a Month after.</p>
            <p>After the Concluſion of this Treaty with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an indiſpenſible neceſſity to accept of thoſe Conditions the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had procured for them. It was in vain for the reſt of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates</hi> to make uſe of all their Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Intrigues, to prevent the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> from accepting of them, who ſigned the Peace on the ſeventeenth of <hi>September</hi> following.</p>
            <p>This done, the King without loſing any further time, order'd his Troops towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi> with an Intention to attack the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Empire with the utmoſt vigour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Winter; ſome of the <hi>German</hi> Princes dreading the Storm that threatned them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to withdraw from the reſt, and to make their Applications to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>States-General</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:95697:103"/>to be comprehended in the Treaty. But <hi>Spain,</hi> purſuant to aſecret Agreement (as it was ſuppoſed) betwixt thoſe two Branches of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> made ſeveral Delays in the Ratification of the Peace, ſo that the time prefixed for the ſaid Ratification, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it had been twice prolonged at the Requeſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi>) was very near expired.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the <hi>French</hi> Forces made frequent Excurſions into the very Heart of <hi>Flanders,</hi> not ſparing even thoſe places that had hitherto eſcaped from being viſited by them; they exacted ſuch vaſt Sums from all the circumjacent Country, and pillaged all ſuch as refuſed to pay them Contributions, that according to the computation and confeſſion of the Enemies themſelves, the flat Country ſuffered more from the time of the ſigning till the Ratification of the Treaty, than it had done in the heat of the War. The Cries and Lamentations of the People did at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Reſolution of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Council, who in ſpite of all the oppoſition made by the reſt of the Allies, cauſed the Peace to be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in <hi>December</hi> in the Year 1678.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the King order'd his Ambaſſadors at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> to declare to the Emperour's Miniſters, that in caſe their Maſter did not think fit to accept of the ſame Conditions as they had been propoſed in the Project of the General Peace, within a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time, that after that there ſhould be no further talk of Peace. This Declaration and the fear they were in of the King's Forces that were approaching the <hi>Rhine,</hi> made the Emperour and Empire at laſt reſolve
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95697:103"/>rather to chuſe the Harbour, than to expoſe themſelves in the open Sea, to ſo dreadful a Tempeſt, as threatned their Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Thus a Peace was concluded betwixt the Emperour and our King in the Month of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> in the Year 1679. upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Peace of <hi>Munſter</hi> ſhould remain in its full force, and that the Emperour ſhould reſign all his Right and Soveraignty over the City of <hi>Friburgh,</hi> and the whole <hi>Alſace</hi> to our King.</p>
            <p>During the Treaty at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the King at the Interceſſion of the Emperour, and the reſt of the <hi>Confederates,</hi> had left it to the choice of Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> whether he would accept of the Poſſeſſion of the Dutchy of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> without that of <hi>Bar,</hi> purſuant to the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty; or whether he would be ſatisfied, if the King reſtored him to the Poſſeſſion of both thoſe Dutchies, reſerving only to himſelf the City of <hi>Nancy,</hi> and all the Grounds and Highways by which the King's Armies were to march into <hi>Germany.</hi> The Prince at firſt choſe the laſt of theſe two, but ſoon after repenting his Choice, refuſed to accept either.</p>
            <p>But tho the Peace was ſigned betwixt the Emperour and the King, the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> proteſted againſt it, continuing to make vaſt Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to maintain themſelves in their Conqueſts taken from the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> But when the <hi>French</hi> Troops began to approach the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> theſe Princes were foon brought to a compliance, and ſhew'd as much eagerneſs for the Peace, as they had
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95697:104"/>ſhewn averſion againſt it before. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> received full ſatisfaction, they being obliged to reſtore all that had been taken from that Crown, without any other Equivalent, but a good Sum of Money, which was paid them by our King.</p>
            <p>It will, without all queſtion, appear ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, and perhaps paſt belief to Poſterity, how <hi>France</hi> ſhould have been ſtrong enough to withſtand ſo many Enemies at one time; and that after they had been vanquiſh'd, they ſhould have been obliged to accept of a Peace upon the ſame Terms, as they were propoſed by our King. It is certain that <hi>France</hi> never made a Peace which proved more Glorious, or more for its Intereſt than this, or which has been managed with more dexterity. The chief Glory of it is due only to our King, who not only himſelf made the firſt Project, but alſo, according to the different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Treaty, directed every ſtep to be taken by his Ambaſſadours and Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries <hi>Godfrey de Eſtrades</hi> Marſhal of <hi>France, Charles Colbert</hi> Marquis <hi>de Croiſſy,</hi> afterwards Miniſter and Secretary of State, and <hi>Anthony de Meſmes</hi> Count <hi>de Avaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Crown'd both with Lawrel and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live-Branches, he was ever after the Object of Admiration, not only of his Subjects, but alſo of all <hi>Europe.</hi>

            <head>AN <hi>ESSAY</hi> UPON THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF <hi>LEWIS</hi> the <hi>GREAT. LIB.</hi> IV.</head>
            <p>THE King having reſtored Peace to <hi>Europe,</hi> employed all his care in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it as durable as poſſibly could be; and having now laid aſide his further thoughts of extending the limits of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95697:105"/>he judged it moſt conducing to his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, to ſecure his Frontiers on all ſides, by good Fortifications. For which purpoſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had conſulted with his beſt Engineers, he himſelf made the Draughts of the moſt conſiderable Fortifications, appointed the Charges and all other particulars belonging to the perfecting of the Works, according to the beſt modern Rules. Never were any places ſeen exceeding either in ſtrength or beauty ſome of thoſe that were, by the King's Orders built in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Alſace,</hi> the <hi>Franche Compte,</hi> to defend the Paſſages of the <hi>Lis,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Saar,</hi> the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and ſeveral other Rivers that border upon his Dominions; it has been computed, that ſince his acceſſion to the Crown, two hundred and twenty Towns, Forts, Citadels, Ports and Harbours have been fortified by his Orders. As he was not inſenſible that the beſt ſafeguard of a Prince is to maintain his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect among his Enemies, ſo not contented with having fortified his Frontiers, unleſs they were alſo guarded by a good number of Troops, he did only disband ſome of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, retaining the beſt in his Service, to render himſelf at all times invincible, tho his thoughts were now more bent to preſerve Tranquility in his Dominions, than to conquer his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>He kept all the Officers of the Disbanded Regiments in Pay, and that he might never want a conſtant ſupply of good Officers,
<note place="margin">The Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for the Cadies.</note> even in time of Peace, he erected many Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of young Gentlemen; theſe were brought up in all Warlike-Exerciſes, and entertain'd at
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95697:105"/>the King's Charge in the Citadels, and when a Captain or Lieutenant's place became va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, it was theſe that ſupplied thoſe Poſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their Deſerts.</p>
            <p>The better to encourage his Troops to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Actions by the aſſurance of a ſafe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in their Native Country,
<note place="margin">The Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids.</note> he cauſed that Hoſpital called the <hi>Invalids,</hi> to be built in one of the Suburbs of <hi>Paris,</hi> a truly magnificent Structure, where thoſe that are render'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable either by Age, or their Wounds, find an honourable Retreat and Reward for their paſt Labours and Toils.</p>
            <p>To afford alſo fome relief to ſuch Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as often ruine their Eſtates in the Service of their Country,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Houſe of St.</hi> Lewis <hi>at St.</hi> Cyr.</note> he founded a Community for three Hundred young Gentlewomen at St. <hi>Cyr.</hi> Theſe young Ladies are educated in this Houſe with particular care from the Age of Seven till Twenty, when they are either provided with ſome advantageous Match, or elſe, if their inclination be otherwiſe, are ſent into a Nunnery. This Noble Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is without parallel in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the reſt the King order'd his Troops to encamp every Year, when he uſed frequently to take a view of them in Perſon, and in his Progreſs to viſit ſome of his Frontier Places, to keep the Governours and Overſeers of his Works and Places in awe, and to encourage them by his Preſence to perform their Duty.</p>
            <p>As he was in the Year 1683. returning from one of theſe Progreſſes,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Death of the Queen of</hi> France.</note> where he had been accompanied by the whole Court the Queen <hi>Maria Thereſia</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> fell dangerouſly ill of a Fever, which put an
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95697:106"/>end to her Life on the 30th of <hi>July,</hi> after four Days Sickneſs. She was a Princeſs endowed with extraordinary Qualities, very Devout, Charitable to the Poor, Liberal to her Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, and Affable to all the World. She had the Happineſs, before her Death, to ſee the <hi>Dauphin</hi> (who was Born at <hi>Fontainbleau</hi> in the Year 1661. the firſt of <hi>November</hi> ſeven Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after Twelve a Clock at Noon) Married to a vertuous Princeſs, and a Father of a very fine young Prince.</p>
            <p>Of ſix Children which ſhe had brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin of</hi> France.</note> 
               <hi>Lewis</hi> the Dauphin of <hi>France,</hi> was the only ſurviving, a very Handſome, and Wiſe Prince, of great Moderation and Vigorous Conſtitution, as active and dextrous in his Military Exerciſes as courageous in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring of Danger.</p>
            <p>Never any Prince had the advantage of a more Noble Education, in reſpect of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of thoſe to whoſe Care and Tuition he was committed; the King having made choice of <hi>Charles de St. Maurice</hi> Duke of <hi>Montauſier,</hi> and Peer of <hi>France</hi> for his Governour, and of <hi>James Boſſuet</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> ſo famous for his many Works, for his Preceptor; but not ſatisfied with this, he never was ſparing in his Paternal Care, to give him in Perſon all the neceſſary Inſtructions for the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of a great Prince. A King, who really loves his Subjects, does in vain ſtrive to raiſe the Glory of his Country by his great Actions, unleſs he alſo be careful to inſtruct his Succeſſour to follow his Footſteps, and to preſerve by his own Courage and Conduct the Reputation which he has acquired. It is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95697:106"/>eaſie to be imagined that there was never a Court in <hi>Europe,</hi> but what moſt earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be joyn'd to us in Alliance by ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous a Match, eſpecially ſince that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement which was ſome Years before nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with the Elector and Electoreſs of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> on the account of Marriage betwixt the Dauphin and the Princeſs of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> ſeem'd to be broken by the Death of the Parents of the ſaid Princeſs; but notwithſtanding this Change, and that the ſaid Match was not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the ſame Advantages as before,

               </note> the King jealous of his Honour and Royal Word, Married the Dauphin to their Eldeſt Daughter, on the 7th of <hi>March</hi> in the Year 1680.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all the Obſtacles and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties raiſed by the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters about the execution of the Treaty of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miguen, Europe</hi> enjoyed the Fruits of a Happy Peace for three Years: In the mean while the King looking upon it as a moſt Glorious Work to turn his Arms againſt the Enemies of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Name, he reſolved to employ his Forces againſt the <hi>Corſairs of Africa,</hi> a Nation whoſe chief Glory, Commerce and Employment, conſiſts in pillaging and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering; ſeveral of their Ships were ſunk, the Sieur <hi>Du Queſne</hi> burnt eight more in the Port of <hi>Chio,</hi> in the Year 1681, and the Marſhal <hi>de Eſtree,</hi> Vice-Admiral of <hi>France,</hi>

            <pb n="172" facs="tcp:95697:107"/>
            <p>The <hi>Algerines</hi> the moſt famous of all the Pyrates on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> for having in the laſt Age out-braved the power of that great Monarch <hi>Charles</hi> V. were ſo preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to declare War againſt <hi>France.</hi> To cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe their Inſolence, the City of <hi>Algier</hi> was Bombarded three ſeveral times;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the Year</hi> 1682, 1683, 1684.</note> after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Bombardment, they were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe ſix hundred <hi>French</hi> Slaves without Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; and in the third they received ſo much damage, that notwithſtanding the Offers of the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> to aſſiſt them againſt us, they ſent their Deputies into <hi>France</hi> to ſue for Peace. The <hi>Genoueſes</hi> had alſo given great occaſion of Diſpleaſure to our King. They were accuſed of having fomented and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged a Conſpiracy which was laid to burn the King's Ships and Gallies in the Ports of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> and <hi>Thoulon;</hi> they had lately embraced the Intereſt and Protection of <hi>Spain,</hi> and had built four new Gallies in order to joyn them with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Squadron. To make them ſenſible of their errour, the King ordered the City of <hi>Genoua</hi> to be Bombarded. Thirteen Thouſand Bombs were thrown into the City with good Succeſs, and the proud City of <hi>Genoua</hi> would certainly have been laid quite in Aſhes by a ſecond Bombardment,
<note place="margin">Genoua <hi>Bombarded</hi>
               </note> if by the Interceſſion of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and their time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repentance, they had not prevented their own ruine.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> had at that time among other Titles, taken upon him that of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector</hi> of the Republick of <hi>Genoua,</hi> but could not prevail with our King that the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth ſhould be comprehended in the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95697:107"/>Truce, which was about the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betwixt theſe two Crowns; but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate their former Miſcarriages, they were forced to ſend in the Year 1685. in <hi>May,</hi> their Doge with four Senators, to make their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the King in the Name of the whole Republick, to implore his Mercy, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch Conditions as he was pleaſed to grant them.</p>
            <p>But we have detain'd our ſelves too long in relating theſe Trifles, there are ſo many things of greater conſequence to be taken notice of in the glorious Reign of ſo great a King, that theſe frivolous Matters ought only to be touch'd upon <hi>en paſſant,</hi> that we may have the more leiſure to purſue the Thread of our Hiſtory in relation to other Affairs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>By Vertue of the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the whole Upper and Lower <hi>Alſace</hi> being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the King with an abſolute Soveraignty over it, and all its Dependencies, the King ſent the next following Year his Summons to all the Princes, Cities, and other Vaſſals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the ſaid Province, to give their appearance to do Homage and Swear Fealty to him. Some obeyed, but the moſt refuſed to appear. Upon their Refuſal, the King erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a certain Chamber of Re-union at <hi>Briſack,</hi> who adjudged their Lands and Fiefs forfeited to the King, according to the Laws of Fiefs, which enjoyn the forfeiture of the Eſtate of a Vaſſal, who either neglects or refuſes to pay the Homage due to his Lord.</p>
            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:95697:108"/>
            <p>At the ſame time the Chamber of Re-union eſtabliſh'd by the King's Order at <hi>Briſac,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chambers of Re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac <hi>and</hi> Metz.</note> took the ſame Method in reſpect of thoſe Fiefs, which had formerly belonged to, and were ſince diſmembred from the three Biſhopricks of <hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun.</hi> As theſe Re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons extended over a vaſt Tract of Ground, ſo the Neighbouring Princes taking the alarm, made their complaints to the Dyet at <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> ſolliciting for aid to ſtop the further progreſs of theſe Proceedings. They were not wanting on their ſide, to repreſent to the Dyet the preſſing neceſſity of applying a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy remedy, but they were very ſlow in their Debates, and much ſlower in their Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Theſe Re-unions being look'd upon by ſome of the Princes of the Empire as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of the Peace, whilſt they pretended to evince them to be no more than the natural conſequences of the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the firſt were for taking up Arms for the Defence of the Empire, the others repreſenting the danger of coming to theſe extremities in ſo critical a juncture.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they thus ſpent their time in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts,

               </note> without coming to any final reſolution, the City of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> the Capital of the <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Alſace,</hi> and one of the moſt conſiderable in all <hi>Germany,</hi> ſubmitted to the King in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> in the Year 1681, before the King's Forces, that were on their March from all the circumjacent Ports, in order to Beſiege it, came in ſight of the Place.</p>
            <p>They enter'd the City on the ſame Day that ſome of the King's Troops took poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Citadel of <hi>Caſal</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As the King ſet out on his Journey to <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> (before he had receiv'd the News of its Surrender) he pretended to take a Progreſs to one of his Country Houſes, but turning ſhort, took the Road towards <hi>Germany.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came to the Frontiers he was advertis'd that his Troops were already receiv'd within the City, but this did not hinder him from purſuing his Journey thither, where he receiv'd the Oath of Fidelity from his new Subjects.</p>
            <p>The taking of this City, which was of vaſt conſequence, ſerv'd only to augment the diviſions among the Members of the Empire at the Dyet of <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> the more, becauſe the King propos'd to adjuſt all thoſe Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, if they pleas'd, in an irreconcilable way. The Miniſters of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> at firſt rejected theſe Propoſitions, but dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Invaſion from the <hi>Turks,</hi> they gave their conſent, ſo that Plenipotentiaries were appointed on both ſides, to meet at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> upon the <hi>Main,</hi> for ſetling the limits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Empire and <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a whole twelve Months being ſpent, before the Conferences were open'd, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome conteſts about Titles and Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, betwixt the Deputies of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and thoſe of the Empire, the King thought fit to recall his Plenipotentiaries, and to remove all occaſions of further delay, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his Miniſter <hi>Lewis Verjus</hi> Count of <hi>Creci,</hi> then reſiding at the Dyet of <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> that he was willing to renounce for ever to all the other Dependencies of <hi>Alſace,</hi> and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95697:109"/>the three above-mention'd Biſhopricks, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that his Pretenſions comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a vaſt tract of Ground, provided the Emperor, and the Empire, would, within a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted time, oblige themſelves to reſign to him the City of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> with all its Territories, and thoſe Lands which he was poſſeſſed off by vertue of the Re-union before the meeting of the Aſſembly at <hi>Frankfort.</hi> Theſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were advantageous enough, foraſmuch as thereby the limits of the Empire and <hi>France</hi> might be ſettl'd upon a ſure Foot, and a firm Peace eſtabliſh'd betwixt theſe two Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Neighbours. The Electoral College were of opinion to accept of the Conditions, but moſt of the Princes being of a contrary ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, two years paſt without coming to a final Reſolution, the King having from time to time prolong'd the prefix'd time, out of a pure motive to generoſity, finding in moſt of the Members of the Dyet, a favourable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for a Peace, at a time when they dreaded an Invaſion from the <hi>Turks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not long before, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army, like an impetuous Torrent, over-run all <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> and carrying all before them, marched up to the Gates of <hi>Vienna,</hi> which was Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by above an hundred thouſand <hi>Turks.</hi>

                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Vienna <hi>in</hi> 1683.</note> The Siege continued two Months, and the place was reduc'd to the laſt extremity, when upon the approach of the Imperial Army, and the Auxiliaries of the Empire, in conjunction with the <hi>Poles,</hi> commanded by <hi>John Sobieski</hi> their King, who with great Bravery attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Enemy in their Lines: The Viſier was forc'd to raiſe the Siege. The Miniſters of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95697:109"/>the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> puff'd up with their late good ſucceſs, preſs'd the Dyet more than ever, not to conclude either a Peace or Truce with <hi>France.</hi> But as ſuch vaſt Empires have many ways to recover their loſſes, the <hi>Turks,</hi> notwithſtanding their late defeat, appear'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſo formidable, that the Emperor and Empire, the better to enable themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them, or to extend their Conqueſts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the King's offers, and about ten Months after, concluded and Sign'd a Truce betwixt the Empire and <hi>France</hi> for twenty Years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spain</hi> alſo agreed to a Truce upon the ſame conditions,

But the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Conferences was delay'd for ſome time, till the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had ſent his full Power and Inſtructions, which, when they were produc'd, it was found, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Titles, that of Count and Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was left out. The next Year the Commiſſioners appointed by both Kings met again at <hi>Courtray,</hi> but the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> intended nothing leſs than to terminate theſe differences, but in lieu of it, left no Stone unturn'd to create new Jealouſies (as much as in them lay) betwixt our King and the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> The City of <hi>Aloſt</hi> furniſh'd them

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95697:110"/>and exacting Contributions from the flat Country; and towards the end of <hi>April</hi> in the Year 1684, a ſtrong Body was ſent to form the Siege of <hi>Luxemburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Place is very ſtrong both by Nature and Art, it being ſituate upon a Rock,
<note place="margin">Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> 1684.</note> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded on all ſides by a River. The King order'd a good Army to advance betwixt <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Valenciennes</hi> to cover the Siege. The Emperor was not wanting in his ſollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Dyet; and the Governor of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Netherlands, as well as the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> made uſe of all their Intereſt, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to endeavour the relief of a Place which was of ſuch conſequence. But all in vain, for no ſuccours appearing, the Place was forc'd to Surrender, after a brave defence of ſeven and twenty Days after open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trenches.</p>
            <p>This done, the King offer'd to reſtore <hi>Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muyden</hi> and <hi>Courtray,</hi> and to renounce all his pretenſions, provided the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would put him in quiet poſſeſſion of <hi>Beaumont, Bovines,</hi> and <hi>Chimay,</hi> three ſmall places without any ſtrength, betwixt the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and would reſign all their pretenſions to <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> which was to be the King's for ever, with the fifteen Villages belonging to it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> refus'd at firſt to hearken to theſe Propoſitions; but the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reflections upon the preſent condition of the Empire; the heavy War wherein the Emperor was engag'd with the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the little hopes there was of receiving aid from <hi>England,</hi> partly by reaſon of the miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that was at that time betwixt King
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95697:111"/>
               <hi>Charles</hi> II. and his Parliament, partly becauſe they were too well acquainted with the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of that King, who prefer'd Peace and his Pleaſures before a War, oblig'd them to accept of theſe conditions. Thus in the Year 1684 a general Truce was concluded for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years; the Emperor, <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire having Sign'd the Treaty within four days one after another.</p>
            <p>But in the mean while that our King was applying his thoughts to re-eſtabliſh Peace in Chriſtendom with good ſucceſs,
<note place="margin">Differences with the Pope.</note> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ariſen betwixt our Court, and that of <hi>Rome</hi> encreaſed more and more every Day; the Pope being ſo far from hearkning to thoſe gentle means that were propos'd for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, that on the contrary his whole behaviour ſufficiently teſtify'd to the World, that he was reſolv'd to carry things to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extremity.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of the Quarrel was given by the <hi>Regale,</hi> which is a certain prerogative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Sovereign, by vertue of which they enjoy the benefit of the Revenues of the Biſhopricks, and the right of beſtowing all Dignities and Prebends, during the vacancies of the Epiſcopal Sees. But it is to be obſerv'd that the Provinces of <hi>Guienne, Dauphine,</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> pretended to be exempted from this rule, whether it were that the Law of Fiefs (which is ſuppos'd to be the Off-ſpring of the <hi>Regale,</hi> and by vertue of which the Lord enjoys the Revenues of the Fief, after the Death of a Vaſſal, till the time of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of his legal Heir) was never intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in thoſe Provinces, among a People that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95697:111"/>were very tenacious of their natural Liberty, or whether they enjoy'd this Prerogative by vertue of ſome particular privileges granted them by their Princes, before they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> I will not pretend to determine.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1608, the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> (which alone takes cognizance and decides matters concerning the <hi>Regale</hi>) on occaſion of a conteſt about a Deanery, vacant in the Church of <hi>Bellay,</hi> declar'd by their Sentence on the 24th of <hi>April,</hi> that the King's prerogative or the <hi>Regale,</hi> ought to take place in all and every place belonging to the Kingdom, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the Lawyers not to argue any thing to the contrary. The Clergy being much alarm'd at this Novelty, made their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. who order'd that this Sentence ſhould not be put in execution, till the whole matter had been further debated and adjudged by King and Council. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly theſe Provinces, by their Deputies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd before the Council, and produc'd their Titles, by vertue of which they laid claim to theſe Privileges; they were taken into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, but it hung in ſuſpenſe till the Year 1673, when after many Proceedings, which laſted near threeſcore Years, the Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, in <hi>February,</hi> the Sentence of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of <hi>Paris;</hi> to wit, that the <hi>Regale</hi> ought to take place in all the Provinces and Territories under the King's Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>The pointed conteſt being chiefly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Province of <hi>Languedock,</hi> all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the ſaid Province ſubmitted to thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:95697:112"/>and <hi>Pamiers,</hi> who made their appeal to the Pope. He was a Native of <hi>Coſmo</hi> in the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneze,</hi> his Name being <hi>Benedict Odeſcalchi,</hi> and afterwards aſſum'd that of <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. a Man of very Virtuous Inclinations, but ſullen in his Temper; zealous to an exceſs, and too much addicted to his own Sentiments, which is the frailty of Men, that even the moſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous are too apt to indulge their own Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; theſe Prelats having by their Letters, and Agents in their Audiences, repreſented the <hi>Regale</hi> to the Pope, as a point of Hereſie ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to deſtroy the true ancient purity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he ſent two Briefs to the King; and in a third, threatned the King no leſs than with the <hi>Fulmen Papale,</hi> or Thunderbolt of the Church, adding theſe following Words; <hi>That he would be made ſenſible in time, that he did not oppoſe him alone, but Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> againſt whom all human Force and Prudenc could not avail.</p>
            <p>Moſt People of ſenſe and unbyaſs'd judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who made it their buſineſs to dive into the Myſtery of this matter, could not but be amaz'd, to ſee the Pope oppoſe with ſo much violence ſo potent a King, and who had ſo lately given ſuch eminent proofs of his Zeal for the Catholick Religion, barely on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the imaginary notion of the two Prelates. It was alledg'd by theſe wiſe Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, that the ſubjection of the Province of <hi>Languedoc</hi> under the Prerogative of the <hi>Regale,</hi> could not be imagin'd to be the true cauſe of the pretended affliction of the Church, no more than the ſame could be imputed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces, that at all times had ſubmitted to the ſame Prerogative.</p>
            <pb n="183" facs="tcp:95697:112"/>
            <p>A difference of this nature might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of very ill conſequence under another Reign, there being too many examples, when ſuch a ſpark has broke out into a flame, which all the art of Men has not been able to quench. It being unqueſtionable, that thoſe conteſts which ariſe with the Church are to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd with a great deal of caution, and that it is ſometimes more conducible, to ſuffer with Patience, than to go about to ſet up a Reformation, which generally proves unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, unleſs with the hazard of occaſioning a Schiſm in the Church.</p>
            <p>There were not a few, who making ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reflections upon theſe differences, were of opinion, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was not ill pleas'd to have met with this opportunity of the <hi>Regale,</hi> and ſome other matters of the like nature to ſerve them as pretences to come to a rupture with us; it has been, ſaid they, the general Maxim of all the Popes for many Years laſt paſt, to keep up, as much as in them lay, the balance betwixt the moſt Potent Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> for fear, leaſt one of them ſhould be put in a condition to preſcribe Laws to the reſt, <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Popedom it ſelf might be in danger of being ſwallow'd up by the moſt Potent. That it was upon this ſcore the Pope had laid hold of this ſpecious pretence, to joyn with the Confederates againſt <hi>France;</hi> the King's Reputation, Proſperity, and Power being rais'd to that pitch, as to give more occaſion of Jealouſie and fear to the other Princes at this time, than the over-grown greatneſs of <hi>Charles</hi> V. did in the laſt Age. The firm reſolution the Pope ſhew'd in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95697:113"/>to his firſt ſentiments, without giving the leaſt ear to the remonſtrances made on our ſide, ſeem'd to intimate to the World, that theſe conjectures were not ill grounded.</p>
            <p>The King, both for his own ſatisfaction, and to endeavour by all means poſſible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Pope to a compliance, ſent the Cardinal <hi>Ceſar d'Eſtree,</hi> in the quality of his Ambaſſador to <hi>Rome,</hi> a Man of a vaſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a great Divine, and a greater Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, who beſides that, had attain'd to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Learning much above the common ranck; but neither the Conduct of this great Miniſter, nor the ſubmiſſion of the King, were prevailing enough with the Pope to make him alter his Sentiments.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> taking into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aſſembly of the</hi> French <hi>Clergy</hi> 1682.</note> this unfortunate conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, made their application to the King, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring leave to call an Aſſembly of the Clergy, in order to concert ſuch meaſures as might either ſatisfie the Pope, or if that did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, might prevent the effects of his threats. The Aſſembly was very remarkable for its number, and the great capacity and known vertue of thoſe that compos'd it. After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving examin'd the Briefs, and well weighed the matter concerning the diſpute about the <hi>Regale,</hi> the Clergy, with the King's appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, came to this Reſolution, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was willing to renounce any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the <hi>Regale,</hi> that ſhould be found contrary to the Diſcipline and Practice of the Church. This <hi>Medium</hi> appear'd to be much more advantageous to the Church in general, than the pretended exemption from the <hi>Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:95697:113"/>could be to thoſe of <hi>Languedock;</hi> but this was ſo far from giving any real ſatisfaction to the Pope, that he look'd upon the whole tranſaction to be a Crime committed againſt his Authority; for which reaſon he ſent no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anſwer to the Letter written to him in the Name of the Aſſembly, but a thundring Brief, in which he had annull'd all what had been done by them in this caſe.</p>
            <p>The Clergy finding him more exaſperated than ever, to put ſome bounds to his Zeal, and to make him ſenſible that his Power was not unlimitted, publiſh'd their Opinions, in which they repreſented to the People, that they ought to pay all due reſpect to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Vicar of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but that they ought not to ſtand in fear of his Power and threats, if they tranſgreſs'd their due bounds. It was at that time that the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> publiſh'd theſe following Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

            <p>Theſe Propoſitions met with a very different reception in Foreign Countries. Some op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd them with all their might, and even in oppoſition to their Sovereigns, condemn'd them, as containing a new broach'd Doctrine. But there were alſo many others who being of a contrary ſentiment, maintain'd in their Writings, that this Doctrine was ſo far from being new fram'd, that it had been always taught and practis'd in the Church, before the eleventh Century. They repreſented to the World, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VIII. upheld by the vaſt Treaſures of the Counteſs <hi>Mathil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> had been the firſt who had been ſo bold as to pretend to depoſe an Emperor, laying hold of the opportunity that offer'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Power by the Inteſtine Diviſions and Civil Wars, which at that time had reduc'd the <hi>German</hi> Empire to the brink of deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That for the firſt thouſand Years, the Popes had always ſubmitted themſelves to the Authority of the General Councils, and that by their own confeſſion, they had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd themſelves to be under a more ſtrict o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation than others, to obſerve their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Decrees.</p>
            <p>There were others alſo, who look'd upon this Declaration of the Aſſembly of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy as very ſeaſonable, at a time when the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in all outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, had no other difference with the King but only to maintain the Privileges of ſome of the <hi>French</hi> Churches: To be ſhort e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one judg'd of the matter according to his Paſſion, it being no new thing that Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95697:114"/>is for the moſt part the fundcmental Rule of any Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But certain it is, that the Pope was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd at the Declaration of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy, that when the King afterwards had nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome of the Members of the Aſſembly, to ſupply the vacant Biſhops Sees, the Pope refus'd to approve of them, alledging that they had given their conſent without ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently weighing the matter, to a Doctrine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to the Rights and Prerogatives of the Papal Chair. It was repreſented to him that theſe conteſts were no Articles of Faith, but in vain, for without being mov'd at our Remonſtrances, he left above thirty Churches vacant in <hi>France,</hi> rather than he would grant his Bulls to any of thoſe that had been Members of the Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>The Pope's refuſal was look'd upon as very unſeaſonable, at a time, when moſt of the Churches in <hi>France,</hi> ſtood more than ever in need of the preſence of their Biſhops; the King applied all his care to root out <hi>Calviniſm</hi> in his Dominions.
<note place="margin">Calviniſm <hi>rooted out in</hi> France</note> A moſt ſurpriſing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, both in reſpect of the greatneſs of the deſign, and the many difficulties that were to be ſurmounted before it could be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. This Sect began firſt under the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> I. neither appear'd they very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> II. but under the Reigns of his Children, they began to be ſo formidable, that they ſeiz'd upon many Cities, demoliſh'd the Churches, beat down the Altars, and broke the Images, committing ſuch unheard of outrages in all places where they were Maſters, that they did even not
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95697:115"/>ſpare the grave of the Dead. After above a Million of brave Men who were deſtroy'd in the Maſſacre, in four pitch'd Battles, in the Sieges and Defence of ſeveral hundred places, and in above three hundred Engagements, they remain'd yet ſo Potent, at the time of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. that to reſtore Tranquillity to the Kingdom, he was forc'd to grant them liberty of Conſcience, many Churches in all parts of <hi>France,</hi> Judges of their own Perſwaſion, and beſides, a free acceſs to all places of Honour and Dignities, to give them great ſums of Money to pay off their Troops, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places as pledges of their future ſecurity, and to ſettle certain Funds to maintain both their Preachers and Garriſons.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. having, after a moſt bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy War which laſted ſeven Years, taken from them and deſtroy'd theſe Sanctuaries, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Nurſeries of Sedition and Rebellion, they were ever ſince without any places of Refuge, or Head, being diveſted of all their Troops and ſtrong holds; nevertheleſs they encreas'd daily in number, ſo that at the time of the King's acceſſion to the Throne, they were computed to exceed two Millions.</p>
            <p>The King immediately after he had taken the management of Affairs into his own Hands, prompted by a moſt laudable Zeal for the true Religion, and taking into ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration their many revolts, their dangerous correſpondence with Foreign Princes, the ſeveral Conſpiracies fomented by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realm, the Cruelties executed by them in former Reigns, had at that time taken a firm Reſolution to root out that Faction. But
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95697:115"/>the firſt Years of his Reign being for the moſt part taken up with the reformation of the State, and the heavy Wars he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards oblig'd to carry on againſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that were grown jealous of his proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, had made him to lay aſide this deſign, or at leaſt, till a happy Peace ſhould furniſh him with a more favourable opportunity. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Sect has once got ſure footing in a State, the moſt violent muſt ſerve only to make them the more inveterate, as too much lenity makes them on the other Hand the more bold and encroaching. The beſt way to humble them, and to make them dwindle away to nothing, is a prudent mixture of ſeverity and indulgence, according to the different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time, the greateſt part of Mankind being more inclin'd to be govern'd by fear, than the dictates of right Reaſon.</p>
            <p>The King being willing to make uſe of all poſſible means to ſuppreſs this Hereſie without much noiſe and trouble, exhorted the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops to take care, that the points in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie betwixt the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> ſhould be fundamentally treated of in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, eſpecially in thoſe places that were moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited by the laſt, and that a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Prudent and Zealous Miſſionaries ſhould be ſent among them, who by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and good Examples, might bring back theſe loſt Sheep to the Sheep-fold. To back their Zeal and Endeavours by his Royal Authority, he promiſed ample Rewards, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Privileges to ſuch of his Subjects as would return into the boſom of the Church. and to puniſh thoſe that remain'd obſtinate;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95697:116"/>he not only excluded them from his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and all other employments of Honour or Profit, but order'd alſo that Soldiers ſhould be quarter'd in their Houſes, till ſuch time that they might be prevail'd upon to change their Opinion. In ſuch a caſe as this it is not ſufficient to give good and wholeſome Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, there being a certain benummedneſs (as it may be ſaid) in Mankind, which owe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Off-ſpring to a long Cuſtom, makes them look with too much indifferency after the means of their Salvation, unleſs they be ſpurr'd on by fear. Moſt Men are ſo prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with prejudices, eſpecially if degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a habit of careleſneſs, that they think it ſcarce ever worth their while to make a due ſearch after Truth, unleſs they be forc'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the apprehenſions of danger, and the deſire of living in quiet.</p>
            <p>The King order'd all the Courts of Juſtice, erected by vertue of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> to be aboliſh'd, and in lieu of them made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Laws in favour of the Catholick Religion, which debarr'd them from that pernicious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of abjuring the true Religion, and thoſe of the Proteſtants who had embrac'd it, to return to their former Errors, and Hereſie, under ſevere puniſhments; to ſhut up all ſuch Churches as receive them, and to forbid the Miniſterial Function to their Preachers. But theſe were too fond of maintaining and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging their Faction, to give ear to the King's Commands, who, to puniſh their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, order'd many of their Churches to be pull'd down, and laid level with the ground; eſpecially in ſuch places where the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95697:116"/>had exercis'd their Divine Worſhip, contrary even to thoſe Edicts which were made in their behalf. It is in this place that with all the reaſon in the World may be apply'd this ſaying, <hi>That there are certain Truths which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo little probable, that they reſemble more a Fable than Truth it ſelf.</hi> Will it not appear incredible to Poſterity, when they ſhall read that we have ſeen in our times ſo ſtrong a Faction dwindle away to nothing, without any violence or commotion? For in four or five Years time whole Cities were re-united to the Obedience of the Church, who had this comfort to ſee by the conduct of her eldeſt Son, Two Millions of her Children return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Boſom. Thus the King in the Year 1685, on the 22th of <hi>October,</hi> annull'd the Edicts of <hi>Nantes</hi> and <hi>Niſmes,</hi> their Churches were all laid level with the Ground, their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters baniſh'd the Kingdom, and <hi>Calviniſm</hi> was entirely rooted out without the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</p>
            <p>As by theſe ſo many and great Actions the love which the People bore to the King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed more and more every Day, ſo it is ſcarce to be expreſs'd with what a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation the whole Kingdom was ſeiz'd, when about a Year after, his Life was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For ſeven or eighth Months before,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95697:117"/>Life, if the Fever had return'd. But the cauſe of it is attributed by many to the exceſs of fear, which ſeizes the faint hearted Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in ſuch an operation; ſo the King having born it without the leaſt commotion, he ſcarce found any alteration, having receiv'd the viſits of many the ſame Day, appear'd in Council the next, and during the whole time he was afflicted with this Evil (which laſted above five Weeks) he manag'd all State-Affairs, and diſpatch'd his Orders with the ſame activity as he was us'd to do before.</p>
            <p>As long as he was judg'd to be in danger, the whole Kingdom offer'd up their Vows for his recovery. Nothing was more frequent than to ſee the Handycrafts Men leave their Employments, and to run in prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the Churches, which were always full from Morning till Night; the People flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in vaſt numbers to Pray for the King's Health. But as they had given moſt evident proofs of their ſorrow and grief hitherto, ſo they ſtrove to out-do one another in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of Joy at his Recovery; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings made upon this Occaſion being riſen to that degree of extravagancy, that it was judged convenient to put a ſtop to them by publick Authority. But if his recovery fill'd all his Subjects with joy and ſatisfaction, his Enemies, jealous of his greatneſs, were the more ſurpriſed, when they found themſelves deceiv'd in their expectation.</p>
            <p>It was above a Year ſince the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> the Miniſters of the Emperor, and the Duke of <hi>Neuburgh</hi> had fomented the jealouſie, which the other Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

The Duke of <hi>Neuburgh</hi> eſpecially, being a very active Prince, and a great Politician, who never miſs'd the leaſt opportunity of promoting his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, had made many Cabals againſt <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> where by his perſwaſions he animated theſe Princes to enter into a League againſt us, inſinuating to them, the danger that threatned them ſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe inſinuations and intrigues were at laſt ſo prevailing, that in the Year 1686, in <hi>July,</hi> an Alliance was concluded at <hi>Augsburgh</hi> againſt <hi>France,</hi> betwixt the Emperor, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the States-General of the United Provinces, the Elector <hi>Palatin,</hi> and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi> many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, and generally all the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi>

            <p>The Heads of this new Confederacy impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this condeſcenſion of our King either to the preſent condition of his Affairs, or the ill ſtate of his health, left no ſtone unturn'd, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to prepoſſeſs the Pope with fears and jealouſies againſt us.

The Ambaſſadors of Crown'd Heads reſiding at <hi>Rome</hi> entertain generally a vaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, ſo that their Palaces being ſeldom large enough to contain ſo great a number of Domeſticks, they are frequently oblig'd to diſpoſe of ſome of them in the next adjacent Houſes, which upon that account were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eſteem'd at <hi>Rome</hi> as belonging to and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the ſame Privileges with the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's Palace it ſelf. for which reaſon the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Juſtice were not allow'd to do their Office in theſe places, which were look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Sanctuary. But it happen'd frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Ambaſſadors Domeſticks, and ſometimes they themſelves made but ill uſe of this Privilege, which made ſeveral Popes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid their Subjects, under very ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſeek for refuge in the Ambaſſador's Quarters, and order'd their Judges not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing like it for the future. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe precautions, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors had maintain'd themſelves in their right, till Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. ſeem'd reſolv'd to aboliſh them for ever.</p>
            <p>For which purpoſe, he immediately after the Death of <hi>Francis Hannibal,</hi> Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees,</hi> (Brother to the Cardinal of the ſame Name) the King's Ambaſſador at <hi>Rame,</hi> by his Bull Excommunicated all ſuch as ſhould pretend to maintain the ſaid Franchiſes of Quarters, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95697:119"/>all thoſe Offenders that ſhould pretend to ſeek for refuge in thoſe places. His judgment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd too much inclining to ſeverity by the conſent of all the World; it being alledg'd, that ſince the Thunderbolt of the Church ought not to aim at any others but hainous Offenders, why ſhould it ſtrike at theſe, who perhaps, by misfortune being fallen into an error, or debts, ſhelter themſelves in thoſe places for the preſervation of their lives and liberty. After the publication of this Bull, <hi>Henry Charles de Beaumonvil,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verdin,</hi> who ſucceeded the Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> in the ſame ſtation at <hi>Rome,</hi> and been preſent at Maſs at Chriſtmaſs-Eve in the Year 1686, in the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Vicar taking it for granted, that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador was fallen under the cenſure of the above-mention'd Bull, order'd the ſaid Church to be ſhut up; but two Months after the ſaid Judgment was revok'd, and the Church open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, notwithſtanding the ſaid Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor had not given the leaſt ſatisfaction, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny demonſtrations of Repentance.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Ambaſſador being, ſince his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at <hi>Rome,</hi> not admitted to the Audience of the Pope, no body knew whether he had put himſelf into the poſſeſſion of the Franchiſes of the Quarters, in order to maintain, or elſe to reſign them into the Pope's Hands; having hitherto acted with ſo much circumſpection, as to this point, that it was the opinion of moſt People, that he had receiv'd Orders from the King to renounce them, ſince he had not forc'd all ſuſpitious Perſons to leave his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but alſo giving ſtrict Orders to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95697:120"/>not to give reception to any for the future. As there had not been any body to ſee him from the Pope, ſo he had not receiv'd the leaſt notice of this Bull againſt the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes of the Quarters, tho' it was evident that it had been publiſh'd a conſiderable time before his arrival; ſo that if the high Character he bore in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Court had not been a ſufficient protection for him againſt the cenſure of this Bull, it would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a very difficult task to evince that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd only as a private Man, he had fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſaid Cenſure. Notwithſtanding all this the Pope remain'd inflexible to all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of the Ambaſſador, who could never obtain to be admitted to his Audience.</p>
            <p>The Allies finding the Pope's reſolute diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſo highly favourable to their preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, made uſe of this opportunity, to bring over ſome of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Princes, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had not ſhew'd much forwardneſs to enter into the Confederacy, by which means they hop'd to ſtrengthen their Party to ſuch a degree, as to be able to cope with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>France;</hi> for which reaſon alſo the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Palatin</hi> made preſſing inſtances at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's (his Father-in-Law's) Court, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Peace with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port, and to ſacrifice ſome of his Conqueſts in <hi>Hungary</hi> to enable them to proſecute the War with the more vigour near the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> ſhew'd about that time great Inclinations for a Peace, which they ſtood much in need of, to recover themſelves of the loſſes and troubles, which their misfortunes abroad and Inteſtine Diviſions at home had caus'd in their
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95697:120"/>Empire; But having obſerv'd the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts to act with too much eagerneſs in what they deſir'd themſelves, they began to take freſh Courage and Reſolution not to make Peace, unleſs upon very good terms. Peace is a thing ſo good and deſirable in it ſelf, as ought not eaſily to be refus'd, when offer'd, but nevertheleſs it is not always advantageous to act in a matter of ſuch conſequence with too much precipitation. In the mean while the Confederates left no ſtone unturn'd to ſtrengthen their Party near the <hi>Rhine,</hi> by the choice of a new Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> ſuch a one as they knew to be abſolutely devoted to their Intereſt, and who ſhould grant a free paſſage to their Troops upon all occaſions. The old Archbiſhop was ſo aged and decay'd in ſtrength,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Affairs of</hi> Cologne 1688.</note> that ſeeing but little probability to live many Years longer, he gave leave to the Chapter of <hi>Cologne</hi> to chuſe a Coadjutor. The Elector <hi>Palatin</hi> being a Prince who knew how to improve all opportunities to his own advantage, made uſe of all his Intereſt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance one of the Princes his Sons to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, being ſenſible that if he could ſucceed in this deſign, to make one of them Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of this Biſhoprick, and conſequently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make himſelf Maſter of two Electorates, there was nothing ſo great, that he might not hope for in time; and there were not a few who ſuſpected, that notwithſtanding this ſtrict Alliance with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> he had not laid aſide all thoughts of meeting with a favourable opportunity to make way for his Sons to the Empire. However it was, both the Emperor and <hi>Hollanders</hi> made uſe of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:95697:121"/>all their Intereſt to back his pretenſions, but all their intrigues prov'd of ſo little effect, that of two and twenty of which the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was compos'd, nineteen gave their Voices for <hi>William Eugene</hi> of <hi>Furſtembergh,</hi> Cardinal and Biſhop of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> Dean of the Church, and Chief Miniſter of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Cologne.</hi> The extraordinary merits of the Cardinal, his great Age and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, his paſt Services, but above all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations both of our King, and the Archiſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> had been ſo prevailing with them, as to prefer him before all others. But theſe reaſons were not convincing enough to his Holineſs, who in oppoſition to all the remonſtrances made to him in the Cardinal's behalf, perſiſted in his reſolution of not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the ſaid <hi>Poſtulation,</hi> tho' it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd on all ſides, that every thing had been tranſacted in due form, and that his Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was look'd upon as the moſt proper means to ſecure the Peace of Chriſtendom. The King writ a Letter to the Pope with his own Hand, which being given to a truſty Meſſenger, the ſaid Envoy ſhew'd the Letter to the Miniſters of his Holineſs, and without diſcovering to them his Inſtructions, told them that he had ſomething to propoſe to the Pope in the King's Name, which would give him all imaginable ſatisfaction. But what is more frequent, than to ſee even the wiſeſt to be miſtaken, when they are only guided and rely too much upon their own Counſels? For, how dangerous ſoever the conſequences of this refuſal were repreſented to the Pope, he could not be prevail'd upon to receive ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95697:121"/>the Letter, or to admit the Envoy into his preſence.</p>
            <p>In the mean while that theſe conteſts were in agitation in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> came to die, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to counter-balance the Intereſt of the Cardinal of <hi>Furstenbergh,</hi> rais'd up Prince <hi>Clement,</hi> Brother to <hi>Maximilian</hi> II. the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as a Competitor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. He was a young Prince of no ſmall hopes, but being not then above ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years of Age, and no Member of the Chapter of <hi>Cologne.</hi> the Pope was forc'd to recede at this juncture from his wonted rigor and the ſtrict rules of the Church Canons, and to grant him a Diſpenſation to qualifie him to be Elected Archbiſhop of the ſaid Church. The Confederates ſtrengthned by the Pope's Brief ſpared neither threats, offers, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes or intrigues. And the Emperor's Envoy told in the Aſſembly of the Chapter, and in the preſence of the Cardinal himſelf, that if they choſe the Cardinal they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be depriv'd of all their privileges. But notwithſtanding all theſe violent procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, fourteen remain'd ſtedfaſt to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, there being only nine that gave their voices for Prince <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>

But a buſineſs of ſuch vaſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95697:122"/>quence, and that in ſo nice a juncture, was not likely to be decided by ſuch formalities as thoſe, but by the powerful influence of the ſtronger party. The Enemies of <hi>France</hi> were not backward to repreſent to the Pope, that by making the Cardinal Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne,</hi> was in effect, to put our King in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Cologne</hi> and the whole Electorate; that the King when once Maſter of <hi>Cologne,</hi> would in a little time be alſo Maſter not only of the Low-Countries, but alſo of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire it ſelf, <hi>Cologne</hi> being the Gate which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd the way into the Empire to over-run the neighbouring Countries at pleaſure. There needed no more to create a jealouſie in the Pope, who being already prepoſſeſs'd either with a prejudice or ill will againſt the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and with a fear of augmenting the King's Power, was ready enough to give ear to the inſinuations of theſe Emiſſaries, and to exclude the Cardinal from the hopes of the Archbiſhoprick, in preferring a Prince of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen Years, before him, whom he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thought worthy of the Cardinal's Cap.</p>

            <p>THE whole <hi>German</hi> Empire was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly alarm'd at theſe Conqueſts made by our King's Forces, but they were ſo far from being caſt down at their loſs, that on the contrary, they ſeem'd to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95697:124"/>have aſſum'd new Courage; each Circle in particular dreading the neighbourhood of ſo potent a Prince, ſtrove to out-vye the other in making new Levies with great expedition, without entring upon the diſpute (as they us'd to do formerly) about the Quota each of them was to furniſh for the defence of the Empire. All the Electors and Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> not excepting even the Elector of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> declar'd unanimouſly againſt <hi>France,</hi> notwithſtanding the Siſter of the laſt was Married to the <hi>Dauphin.</hi> He had ſignaliz'd himſelf upon ſeveral occaſions in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and was now reſolv'd to maintain his Brother in the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Cologne;</hi> beſides, that he was flatter'd with the hopes of Succeſſion in <hi>Spain.</hi> Theſe Obligations were ſo prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this Prince, that contrary to the Maxim practis'd in the Houſe of <hi>Bavaria</hi> for many Years paſt, to balance the power of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> he became one of the Heads and the moſt paſſionate adherents to the Confederacy.</p>
            <p>It is ſcarce poſſible to be conceiv'd that ſo many Sovereigns as compoſe the <hi>German</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ſhould be ſway'd by the ſame intereſt,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The whole Empire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> France.</note> and be all of the ſame opinion, the more, ſince Hiſtory can ſcarce furniſh us with an inſtance for many Ages paſt, when they have been thus united in one League, eſpecially in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſing the Emperor's Quarrel, it being look'd upon as one of the fundamental Maxims to maintain the Liberty of the Empire, rather to diminiſh than to favour the deſigns and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of their Emperors. It appear'd to moſt Politicians, a thing the moſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95697:125"/>in the World, to ſee theſe Princes ſo forward in running themſelves in a War, the benefit whereof would only redound to the Emperor, whilſt they in the mean while diſinabled themſelves to reſiſt his power, when at any time hereafter he ſhould meet with a favourable juncture to fall upon them.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the conjunction of the forces of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Emperor and Empire ſcarce thinking themſelves ſtrong enough to reſiſt the King's Victorious Arms without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupplies, they made their applications to all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> even the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and to the other Northern Princes, who by their vaſt diſtance feem'd to have but little concerns in the affairs of thoſe parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Swiſs Cantons</hi> were more than once ſollicited to enter into the Confederacy, or at leaſt to grant a free paſſage to their Troops. But as they did not fear their threats, ſo they rejected all their advantageous offers, perſiſting in their reſolution, to keep an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act neutrality, according to the examples of their Anceſtors, who thereby drew the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the neighbouring Countries into their Country, and made themſelves to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and courted by the moſt powerful Princes of <hi>Europe:</hi> among all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> tho' there were very few but what were glad to ſee a check put to the King's power, yet not one declar'd againſt us except <hi>Victor Amadeus</hi> II. the preſent Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>

            <p>The Glorious Name of being Generaliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo over a great Army, which the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates had promis'd to ſend to his aſſiſtance, the

The War in <hi>Piedmont</hi> is always extreamly chargeable to <hi>France;</hi> all the Cannon, Ammunition, and Proviſions, muſt be carried upon Mules thro' impaſſable Roads, and out Troops could not but ſuffer great inconveniencies in paſſing and re-paſſing theſe inacceſſible Mountains, ſo that nothing could be more advantageouſly contriv'd for the Intereſt of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, than to oblige our King to carry on a War on that ſide, where beſides all the before-mention'd inconveniencies, our Frontiers lay expos'd to our Enemies; it having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Intereſt of <hi>Savoy</hi> to keep a good correſpondence with <hi>France,</hi> and the ſtrict Alliances betwixt theſe two Courts, the King's reputation and ſtrength having been look'd upon as a ſufficient ſafe-guard and Bullwark for the ſecurity of our Frontiers in thoſe parts. It was upon this account that the Allies flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd themſelves with the hopes of making a powerful irruption upon us, and to penetrate into the very heart of the Kingdom on this ſide, where it was leaſt defenſible; but tho' they promis'd themſelves no ſmall advantages from this diverſion, the main foundation of their hopes was laid on the expected change of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95697:126"/>affairs in <hi>England,</hi> which prov'd to their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, at a time when it was not ſo much as dream'd of by us.</p>
            <p>There ſeems to be a great ſympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Climate and the humour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, the Government being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to as many Revolutions, as the weather is changeable in that Iſland, which, tho' very frequent here, yet are nothing the leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing in their events. The great diverſity of Religions, which has been introduc'd ſince the time of their ſeparation from the ancient Church, is an inexhauſtible ſcource of the many inteſtine troubles and diviſions, which at ſeveral times have brought this Monarchy to the very brink of ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James</hi> II. when Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Revolution in</hi> England 1688.</note> was upon the point of having been excluded from the ſucceſſion of the Crown by one of the Houſes of Parliament, notwithſtanding which, he mounted the Throne, after the Death of his Brother, with the general Acclamation of the People, at a time when he made publick profeſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. This No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confidence of not diſſembling his Religion, ſtood him in no ſmall ſtead with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who look'd upon this his greatneſs of mind, as a pledge of their future ſafety, and that his Word would at all times ſtand inviolable to protect their Laws and Liberties. But it was not long before they chang'd their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the whole Nation being alarm'd at the Zeal they obſerv'd in him of advancing the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> which was improv'd to the King's diſadvantage by a contrary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who nois'd it about in the ears of the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95697:126"/>People, that his main deſign was to overturn their Laws, and to eſtabliſh upon their ruins an Arbitrary power. The whole Kingdom being put into confuſion and fears, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enter into an Aſſociation, headed by the Chief Men among the Commons, and moſt of the Nobility, who under hand treated with <hi>Holland,</hi> and obtain'd powerful ſuccours with ſo much ſecreſy, that there was not the leaſt thing diſcover'd of it, till a few Months before the arrival of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> at the head of an Army in <hi>England.</hi> The train was ſo well laid, and the whole matter ſo well tim'd, that when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> landed in <hi>Torbay</hi> with twenty thouſand Men, both the Nobility and Gentry flock'd to him in great numbers, all the Cities open'd their Gates, both the Fleet and Army declar'd for him, and abandon'd their King's Intereſt, that to ſave his Life, or at leaſt to preſerve his Liberty, he was oblig'd to fly and ſeek for refuge in <hi>France.</hi> A moſt notable inſtance of the inſtability of all human greatneſs! If this Prince had accepted of our King's offers, Things would in all probability never have been brought to that extremity; for no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty been adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd of what was in agitation in <hi>Holland,</hi> but he ſent word to the King of <hi>England,</hi> that he would either ſend a <hi>French</hi> Army to his aſſiſtance, or elſe by giving a powerful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> prevent their deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But the King of <hi>England,</hi> who flatter'd himſelf with theſe hopes, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> being his Nephew and Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law, would ſcarce be prevail'd upon to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95697:127"/>head a Faction againſt him, and that if he ſhould have any ſuch intention, his Fleet and Army were a ſufficient guard to him againſt any attempts of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> was not, till it was too late convinc'd of his miſtake. For no ſooner had the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſet Foot upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhoar, but he found the whole Nation ready to receive him, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing was thus diſpos'd, that after the departure of the King of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nation ſhew'd more forwardneſs in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing him to the Throne, than he did, in all outward appearances, in accepting of it. For at the firſt meeting of the States of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Throne of <hi>England</hi> being declar'd vacant, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was Proclaim'd, Crown'd,
<note place="margin">

            <p>It having been always look'd upon as a thing paſt all diſpute among the Confederates, that the power of <hi>England,</hi> if joyn'd with the Confederacy, would over-balance, or at leaſt equalize that of <hi>France;</hi> they now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd themſelves to be arriv'd at the higheſt pitch of their proſperity; for which reaſon they boaſted in all places, that <hi>France</hi> would fcarce be able to hold out two or three Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns, after the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) ſhould have joyn'd the Forces of three Kingdoms with the Confederate Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:95697:127"/>of <hi>France</hi> as reduc'd to the very brink of deſtruction, block'd up both by Sea and Land, ſcarce able to withſtand five or ſix Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that were to attack it on all ſides at a time; but theſe unexperienc'd Politicians were ſoon after convinc'd that they had tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd before the Victory was obtain'd. Theſe vaſt preparations made by the Allies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France,</hi> rather ſerv'd to augment than diminiſh the Glory of our King, who in nine Years time gain'd ſeveral Battels, and took many of their beſt Towns, ſome of which they have been forc'd to re-gain with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible charges, and greatloſs of their beſt Men.</p>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95697:128"/>a good number of Troops in the Year 1689, with a ſufficient quantity of Arms, Ammunition, and other neceſſaries. The King of <hi>England</hi> having put himſelf at the head of theſe Troops, in conjunction with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces that had taken up Arms for him, he advanc'd againſt the Enemy with indifferent ſucceſs, there happening nothing of moment all that Campaign, as there was no great action in other parts, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) judging it more for his advantage at that time, to eſtabliſh himſelf in <hi>England</hi> by his Preſence, and our King having taken a reſolution to be upon the defenſive this Campaign, the better to enable himſelf to ſend more powerful Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to try whether perhaps by ſome means or other, the Confederacy would not diſſolve it ſelf againſt the next Campaign. It is eaſie to be imagin'd, that among Princes of ſo many different Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Intereſts, the War is generally not carry'd on with the ſame Vigour as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, there being frequent Examples that the ſtricteſt Alliances have been broken with as much eaſe as they were made.</p>
            <p>For, near the <hi>Alps</hi> there ſcarce appear'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Armies in the Field. The Duke of <hi>Noailles</hi> took <hi>Campredon</hi> in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd quickly after. The Armies in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> did nothing but look upon one another, there having been ſcarce any Action there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts all that Summer, but the Aſſault made upon <hi>Wall-Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being a place of ſmall defence, the Marſhal <hi>d'Humiers</hi> thought to have carri'd it
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95697:128"/>by Storm, without making a Breach; but the Euemies who were retir'd before the Marſhal, having poſted themſelves upon ſome eminencies behind the Town, ſo as to keep a communication with one of the Gates, they ſent from time to time as many freſh Forces as were requiſite to defend the Place; ſo that the Marſhal was repuls'd with the loſs of five hundred Men killed and wounded, among whom were thirty or forty Officers, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brave Volunteers, who paid with their lives for the miſtake of the Marſhal, who had been miſguided by his Spies.</p>
            <p>The Allies Forces near the <hi>Rhine</hi> conſiſted of threeſcore and ten thouſand Men, divided into three ſeveral Bodies, under the Command of Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the Electors of <hi>Bavaria, Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh.</hi> To prevent the Enemies taking up Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters too near our Frontiers, we were oblig'd to ravage all the Country of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and the whole <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and to lay all deſolate as far as <hi>Strasburgh.</hi> The Cities of <hi>Spires</hi> and <hi>Worms</hi> were laid in aſhes, and all the other Places thereabouts, of which we had taken poſſeſſion the Year before, were demoliſh'd, except <hi>Mayence, Bonn, Philipsburgh,</hi> and <hi>Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerwaerth;</hi> the laſt of which being a ſmall Town of little ſtrength upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> was by <hi>Frederic</hi> II.

            <p>The City of <hi>Mayence</hi> was Beſieg'd by the Imperialiſts,

               <hi>Saxony,</hi> who joyn'd their Forces with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This Place was the Year before, when the Elector of the ſame name receiv'd a <hi>French</hi> Garriſon into the Town, ſo inconſiderable in its Fortifications, that tho' a great number of Workmen were employ'd all the Winter long to put them in a ſtate of defence, they could ſcarce bring the Out-works to perfection. Its chiefeſt ſtrength at that time conſiſted in a good Garriſon of nine or ten thouſand Men, all reſolute brave fellows, who unanimouſly reſolv'd to hold it out to the laſt extremity. If it was Attack'd with all imaginable Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, there has not been a Place in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Men defended with more bravery, In forty eight days after opening of the Trenches, the Beſiegers had only made one Lodgment upon the utmoſt point of the Counterſcarp. The Beſieg'd made frequent Sallies at Noon-day, with their Colours flying, and Drums beating, ſometimes three or four times in one Day, within two hours of one another. They marched out ſometimes with a Body of two or three thouſand Men in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Battel, engag'd the Enemy, cut in pieces thoſe that guarded the Trenches, nail'd up their Cannons, fill'd up their Works, and once drove the Enemies back at ſuch a diſtance from the Place, that their main Horſe-guard took Poſt at the very Head of their Trenches. The Confederates having often felt the effects of the deſperate reſolution of the Beſieg'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to Attack and carry the Counterſcarp, let it coſt what it would. Purſuant to this reſolution, all their Batteries play'd moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly by break of Day, and thus continu'd,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95697:129"/>till by the throwing of certain Bombs, the Signal was given for the Aſſault. In a few moments you might have ſeen the Ground cover'd with dead Carcaſſes, the Cannon of the Beſieg'd, their Hand-Grenadoes and Bombs, their Fire-Arms, but eſpecially their Swords made ſuch havock among the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as is rather to be conceiv'd than to be expreſs'd. The Aſſault laſted five Hours, when the Beſieg'dbeing at laſt over-power'd by the great number of their Enemies, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion, ſeconded their Men with freſh Troops, were forc'd to give way, and to leave them Maſters of the Counterſcarp, but with the loſs of four thouſand Men on the Confederate ſide. The Beſieg'd having, beſides this, loſt, during the Aſſault, all their Ammunition, by a Bomb which blew up their Magazin, they offer'd to try the next Day to regain the Counterſcarp with their Swords in Hand, but the Marquis <hi>d'Uxelles,</hi> their Governor, being unwilling to Sacrifice ſo many brave Fellows in the attempt, beat a Parley, and the Allies being not backward in granting him very Honourable Conditions, the Garriſon march'd out of the Place with their Colours flying, and ſix pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:95697:130"/>which the Beſieg'd defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a great deal of reſolution, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to out-vye the Garriſon of <hi>Mayence</hi> in the defence of this Place; they were very ſucceſsful in their Sallies, in one of which they miſs'd but narrowly of the Elector him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who being left by his Guards, was in great danger of having been carried Priſoner into the Town. After the taking of <hi>Mayence,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> march'd with a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reinforcement to Beſiege the Place in due form, but could not make himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of it till a Month after, the brave Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Bidal,</hi> Baron of <hi>Asfelt</hi> refuſing to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to a Capitulation, till all the Out-works were taken, and that he had neither Proviſion nor Ammunition left, nay not ſo much as room enough to make new Entrenchments behind the ruin'd Baſtions.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Sieges coſt the Enemies near twenty thouſand Men, and the remainders of their Army were ſo haraſs'd, by theſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Fatigues, that they were forc'd to ſeek for Winter-quarters in <hi>October</hi> following, in their own Territories.</p>

We took from them forty nine pieces of Cannon, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and twelve Standards, eight pair of Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Drums, and an hundred and fifty Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons loaden with Ammunition. We had on our ſide three thouſand killed or wounded,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95697:131"/>among whom were many Perſons of note, who were much lamented. After the loſs of this Battle, the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> came with a ſtrong reinforcement to joyn the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken remainders of this Army, but they did nothing further this Campaign than to pillage <hi>Flanders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Victory at Sea.</note> which after this Battle became a prey both to Friends and Foes. Scarce ten Days were expir'd after this Victory, when the King's Arms were bleſs'd with another at Sea, over the Confederate Fleet of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch.</hi> In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. there was not one Galley or Man of War in all the Ports of <hi>France.</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. was the firſt who began to ſettle our Maritime affairs, which yet he left but in a very indifferent condition. The preſent King, immediately after his acceſſion to the Crown, ſpar'd no coſts to draw into <hi>France</hi> from the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries, as many able Seamen and good Officers as he could; notwithſtanding which, his Naval ſtrength was for a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time much inferiour to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> till in the Year 1681, he gave ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Encouragement to the Seamen, that in the ſame Year threeſcore thouſand of them were Regiſtred, of whom twenty thouſand are in their turns employ'd in the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the other forty thouſand in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Men. His next care was to encourage the building Men of War, to keep his Ports in ſuch a condition, as to be able to contain a good number of ſtout Ships, and to erect Magazins in convenient places with all ſorts of Naval Stores, in all which he ſucceeded ſo well, that without reckoning thirty Galleys,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:95697:131"/>which he always maintain'd in the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,</hi> he had a Fleet of an hundred Men of War for the line of Battle, in the Year 1690, in the Ocean, ſo well equip'd and provided with every thing, that there were ſome, who affirm'd, that one of ours was equivalent to three of the Enemies.</p>
            <p>The King had no ſooner receiv'd intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets were joyn'd in the Channel, but he immediately diſpatch'd his Orders to the Count of <hi>Tourville</hi> Vice-Admiral in the <hi>Levant</hi> to fight them. The Count <hi>de Tourville</hi> is a younger brother of a Family in <hi>Normandy,</hi> a Man of Fortune,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Count de</hi> Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</note> but who in lieu of an Eſtate, had all the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities belonging to a great Commander, ſo that even in his younger days, he gave all the imaginable hopes of becoming one Day one of the beſt Sea Commanders this Age has produc'd ſince the Death of <hi>de Ruiter</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſne,</hi> and his gallant Actions have been moſt evident demonſtrations to the World, that if he did not ſurpaſs them, he alone did not fall ſhort of them both.</p>
            <p>The Enemies Fleet conſiſted of thirty Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, as many Frigats, and fourſcore Men of War. The <hi>French</hi> Fleet was not above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and fifteen Men of War for the Line of Battle, beſides twenty Fireſhips, ſix Frigats, and twenty other Ships loaden with Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and other neceſſaries. The Enemies had the Wind of us for ſeven days together, but ſhew'd no inclination to come to an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not being able to avoid it at laſt,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95697:132"/>bravery, the Count <hi>de Tourville,</hi> and all the reſt of the Sea-Commanders ſhewing upon this occaſion, their utmoſt skill in the management of a Sea-Engagement, which laſted ſeven hours, and did not ceaſe till the Enemies bore away towards their own Coaſt. The loſs on our ſide was very inconſiderable, one of their Bombs carried away the Stern of one of the King's Ships, the reſt receiv'd very little damage. There being not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that had loſt her Maſts. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies had at leaſt four thouſand Men kill'd in this Action. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> bearing away in good time, came off without much loſs, on their ſide, but the <hi>Hollanders</hi> fighting like Lions, we took one of their Ships of ſixty Guns; another was ſunk, and a third burnt; beſides, there were twelve more of their beſt Ships ſo much diſabled, in their Maſts and Riggings, that not being able to carry them off, they were forc'd to ſink and to burn them. The Count <hi>de Tourville</hi> purſu'd them for two days after, and would in all probability have deſtroy'd their whole Fleet, if the Wind had not turn'd againſt him, which gave the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my opportunity to bring the reſt of their Ships into a place of ſecurity.</p>
            <p>This diſgrace put the Enemies into no ſmall conſternation, foraſmuch as they had flatter'd themſelves that they were much ſuperiour to us at Sea, and that no body hitherto had been bold enough to diſpute with them the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the Sea. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>Willian</hi> III.) laying the cauſe of this diſaſter to the miſmanagement of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral, he was tryed and acquitted of what
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95697:132"/>was laid to his charge. But, whilſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> made heavy complaints on both ſides, laying the loſs of the Battle at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Doors, the <hi>French</hi> obtain'd another ſignal Victory about five Weeks after, being the eighteenth Day of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>

Both the Armies were near equal in number, that of the Allies being Commanded, under the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by ſome of their beſt Officers. The Sieur <hi>de Catinat,</hi> Commander in Chief of the <hi>French</hi> in thoſe parts, appear'd the firſt time in this Campaign at the Head of a great Army; He was deſcended from a Family that ow'd its Off-ſpring to the Gown, but by his many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices render'd himſelf not inferiour to any of our age, that have rais'd their Families by the Sword. This wiſe General having taken a view of, and found a paſſage thro' the Boggs, attack'd the Enemy on that ſide with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bravery, that their left Wing was brought immediately into confuſion; the right Wing held it out for ſome time after, but being likewiſe broken at laſt, a great ſlaughter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, moſt of their Infantry being cut to pieces, and their Cavalry ſav'd themſelves by repaſſing the River <hi>Po,</hi> leaving the Field, and their whole Artillery, (except one piece of Cannon, which was thrown into the River)
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:95697:133"/>with I all their Ammunition and many Colours and Standards to the mercy of the Enemy. Four thouſand of them were kill'd upon the ſpot; whereas on our ſide we had not above an hundred and fifty dead, and four hundred wounded Men. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which with ſome part of <hi>Piedmont</hi> ſubmitted immediately after to our King, was the firſt Fruit of this Victory.

            <p>But whilſt they ſpent their time in debates, they receiv'd the unexpected News that the City of <hi>Mons</hi> had been inveſted by the <hi>French</hi> on the fifteenth of <hi>March,</hi> and that the King was expected in the Camp by the twentieth or one and twentieth of the ſame Month. This ſudden News, like a Thunderclap, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd the whole Congreſs. Moſt of the Princes there preſent return'd ſtraightways into their reſpective Countries, either becauſe they did not think it convenient to be Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators of the taking of the Place, or to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten their Troops to march to the relief of it.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Mons</hi> is ſituate upon a riſing ground, ſurrounded with Boggs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtrong, both by Art and Nature. It is a very large Town provided with good Out-Works, having three ſeveral Ditches, which are always full of Water, by means of ſome Sluyces built for that purpoſe. There was within the Place a very good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, the Inhabitants were train'd up in all ſorts of Military Exerciſes, and the Garriſon
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95697:134"/>conſiſted of five or ſix thouſand Men, all well diſciplin'd Troops. But the time of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Quarters being not expir'd, moſt of the Officers were abſent from their Commands, and the Lines of circumvallation were ſo well guarded, that notwithſtanding all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, not one of them got into the place. The Lines being brought to perfection, the Cannon began to play from the Batteries with incredible fury, one battery ſeconding the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without intermiſſion, and with ſo much diſpatch, that by the confeſſion of the moſt expert Engineers, never any Artillery did greater execution.

                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Mons.</note> Four and twenty Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and ſixty pieces of great Cannon were continually employ'd againſt the Place; there was above a million of Powder laid up in the Camp for the ſupply of them; ſo that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you turn'd your Eyes you ſaw nothing but Bombs and hot Bullets flying in the Air, which ſet the whole City on Fire, ſo that you might behold the Flames riſe beyond the tops of the higheſt Steeples. The King was Day and Night in motion, there paſſed not a Day but that he viſited the Trenches once or twice, encouraging by his preſence every one in his ſtation to do his Duty, with ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that both the Officers and Soldiers ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much eagerneſs in out-braving one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that the King, to moderate their heat, ſaw himſelf oblig'd to forbid them not to work uncover'd, and to carry their Faſcins (as they did frequently) at Noon day, in ſpite of the continual fire of the Garriſon, to the Trenches; for they ſeem'd to have put their chief hopes in their Artillery, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95697:135"/>not made one Salley during the whole Siege. The only place which was defended with much gallantry was a Horn-Work, which the <hi>French,</hi> making their way thro' the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes and Carcaſſes of the Enemy, which fell as thick as Hall among them, carried with Sword in Hand. The Citizens of <hi>Mons</hi> were all along in hopes that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) would come to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and in effect he march'd with an Army of forty thouſand Men as far as <hi>Hall,</hi> within ſix Leagues of <hi>Mons,</hi> but finding himſelf not ſtrong enough to Attack our King, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in thar poſt till after the Surrender of the Place, which finding it ſelf not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſuſtain a General Aſſault, came to a Capitulation, after a Siege of ſixteen Days.</p>
            <p>After the taking of <hi>Mons,</hi> the Troops on both ſides return'd to their Winter-Quarters, and the following Campaign was ſpent in marches and counter marches, without any remarkable Action.

The Enemies loſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to fifteen hundred, beſides which we took three hundred Priſoners, and forty Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards.

This brave Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was perform'd only with the loſs of four hundred Men killed and wounded on our ſide.</p>
            <p>In all other places the King's Arms were Crown'd with the ſame ſucceſs.

But his Fleet being ſeparated by the darkneſs of the Night, one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his biggeſt Ships gain'd the Port of St. <hi>Malo,</hi> where they were ſufficiently ſecur'd againſt any attempt of the Enemy: But fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen others not being able to ſteer the ſame courſe, by reaſon of the contrary Winds,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95697:137"/>were ſo cloſely purſued, that being in danger of being taken, they run a-ſhoar, and after having taken out all their Cannon, and moſt of their Rigging, the <hi>French</hi> ſet fire to them, rather than to leave them a prey to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch.</hi> Nothing is more common in the World than to lay the ill ſucceſs of an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe at the Door of him who has had the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Direction and Management of it, moſt People looking upon a diſaſter of this nature to proceed chiefly from the ill Conduct of the General; whereas they attribute the happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of a Battle merely to Fortune. But it muſt be confeſs'd, that <hi>Tourville</hi> had the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to hear his Enemies give him this Character; <hi>That he had acquitted himſelf upon this Occaſion as a great Commander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the taking of <hi>Namur</hi> did ſurpriſe the Confederacy and all <hi>Europe</hi> in ſuch a manner,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Namur <hi>by the</hi> French.</note> that our ſucceſs in <hi>Flanders</hi> ſoon effaced the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the diſgrace received at Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Namur</hi> is ſituated at the confluence of two Rivers; the City lies in a Plain; the Caſtle is built upon a Rock, both are very regularly fortified; this being one of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable places in all <hi>Flanders</hi> for its Situation, and of ſuch conſequence, that in the laſt Age, this being the only Place in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> remaining in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Hands, they by the help of it, recover'd all the reſt of the Low-Countries, which have been in their poſſeſſion ſince. The ſeveral Works belonging to the Caſtle were like ſo many Citadels, each of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:95697:138"/>them being provided with its Out-Works, Ditch, a particular Garriſon and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In the Fort <hi>William</hi> alone was a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of two thouſand Men, and a train of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, ſufficient to defend a great City. Theſe Forts being built upon an aſſent which reaches up to the body of the Caſtle command one another. And defend the avenues leading to it. At the time when it was beſieged by the King, the Place was provided with a Garriſon of eight or nine thouſand Men, with great ſtore of Ammunition and Proviſion of all ſorts, under the braveſt and moſt expert Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers among the Confederates. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) was at that time in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Confederates were ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous on that ſide that they could bring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether an Army of an hundred thouſand Men. But all theſe obſtacles were not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of altering the King's reſolution, who, after every thing was in a readineſs for the carrying on of ſo great an Enterpriſe, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two ſeparate Armies to take the Field in <hi>Flanders;</hi> the leſs numerous of the two was employed in the Siege, the other to cover it againſt any attempt of the Enemy. Theſe two Armies conſumed every Day two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand Rations of Bread, and thirty thouſand <hi>French</hi> buſhels of Oats, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing half a buſhel for each Horſe a Day. And the King had taken ſuch ſure meaſures as to all the neceſſary Supplies, that as long as the Siege laſted, there was always in both Camps no leſs than for fifteen Days Proviſion. Twenty thouſand Pioneers were employed in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:95697:138"/>making the Lines of circumvallation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travallation, and the Trenches were opened in three Days after. The City made at firſt a vigorous Defence, but capitulated on the eighth Day, finding it ſelf not in a condition to ſuſtain a general Aſſault. The ſurrender of the City made the Enemy fear, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, tho' accounted impregnable, might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of the City; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) Count <hi>Waldeck</hi> General of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces, and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who had lately been made Governour of the remaining part of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> advanced and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted themſelves near the Banks of the River <hi>Meheigne.</hi> Theſe three Bodies made together an Army of near an hundred thouſand Men, which was continually in motion to intercept our Convoys, or to endeavour to force our Quarters, if they ſhould find an opportunity. The Marſhal <hi>de Luxemburgh,</hi> not inferiour in number to the Confederates, being encamped on riſing Ground on the other ſide the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heigne,</hi> at about half a Leagues diſtance from the River, expected them in good order, there being a large Plain betwixt them and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. But the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> III.) had either no inclination to hazard a Battle, or elſe could not meet with a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opportunity to put his deſign in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he cauſed five or ſix ſeveral times Bridges to be laid over the River, but they were immediately broken down again. Thus theſe two great Armies encamped within ſight of one another for a whole Month, exactly
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95697:139"/>obſerving and following one another's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, frequently ſaluting one another with their Cannon, without coming to handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blows. In the mean while the Siege was carried on with all imaginable vigour, the King not only giving his Directions upon all occaſions of moment, but alſo ſeeing them put in execution. Being ſeiz'd with the Gout when they were juſt ready to attack a covert way, he cauſed himſelf to be carried in a Chair to a certain Place, from whence he could ſee all what paſſed, and give the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Orders, as occaſion ſhould require.</p>
            <p>Here it was that <hi>Lewis Alexander</hi> Count of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> was wounded by his ſide. It was obſervable that there did not appear the leaſt change in this young Prince's Countenance at this miſhap, a happy preſage of thoſe many courageous Actions, he has ſince that time gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuch eminent proofs of in the following Campaigns. The King's Forces being ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by his Preſence, and Example, never behaved themſelves ſo well in any Siege what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, giving every Day innumerable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of their Courage and Patience, for the beſieged fired without intermiſſion. The weather was extreamly bad during the whole Siege, the Soldiers being continually fatigu'd by the Rains and Tempeſts; beſides which, they met with ſo many Rocks in the carrying on of the Trenches, that they could advance but ſlowly, and with a great deal of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they being forc'd to carry them round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeveral great Hills, and large Valleys, which took up a vaſt compaſs. But all theſe
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95697:139"/>obſtacles ſerved only to augment the Patience and Courage of our Soldiers. It was next to a prodigy to ſee ſome of them crawl up bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Breaches, and to endeavour to keep their Poſt only with their Swords in Hand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a vaſt number of Enemies, who power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whole ſhowers of ſmall-ſhot at them, whilſt they return'd them as many Hand-Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes as they were able to throw. The firſt and the braveſt Action that happened in the whole Siege was near a certain Eminency, where the Enemy having ſtrongly Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, we were forc'd to drive them from that Poſt before we could open our Trenches before the Caſtle. The King's Troops attack'd them with Sword in Hand, and Bayonetts in their Fuſees: They fired very briskly from their Entrenchments, which our Troops having ſuſtained with great bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the Enemy at their approach quitted the Poſt, after they had loſt two or three hundred Men. Within ſix Days after we forc'd their retrenchments and redoubts of the Hermitage. The Fort <hi>William</hi> defended it ſelf ten Days: On the tenth we carried the Covert-way, not without great ſlaughter on both ſides, when the <hi>Dutch</hi> Garriſon came immediately to a Capitulation. This done there was remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet the Caſtle with all its Out-works. This was the moſt difficult task, but by the King's preſence the Works were carried on ſo vigorouſly, that in five Days time we made an Aſſault upon the Counterſcarp. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged defended themſelves with all the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage imaginable, but were at laſt forced to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95697:140"/>way to the numbers of the Beſiegers, who were from time to time ſeconded with freſh Troops; ſoon after all their Cannon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſmounted, one of their chief Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins blown up by two of our Bombs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother being fallen into the great Ciſtern which furniſhed the Caſtle with Water, and our Mines ready to ſpring under one of the Baſtions of the Horn-work, what with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt, what with fear of not being able to ſuſtain a General Aſſault, for want of Sleep, occaſioned by the continual throwing in of Bombs, they were neceſſitated to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to a Capitulation, notwithſtanding that the body of the Caſtle was entire, and that they had as yet a Horn-work left which would have coſt us no ſmall trouble to take. Out of eight or nine thouſand Men, of which the Garriſon of <hi>Namur</hi> conſiſted at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Siege, there were but twelve hundred left in the Fort <hi>William,</hi> and two thouſand five hundred in the Caſtle, when they marched out. The reſt periſhed either by ſickneſs, or were killed by our Bombs, or in the ſeveral Attacks and Sallies.</p>
            <p>The taking of <hi>Namur</hi> in the ſight of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of an hundred thouſand Men, put all the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> under a moſt terrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation; the common people being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſſatisfied that the relief of a place of ſuch conſequence had not as much as been attempted by the Confederate Army, affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nay aſſaulted the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other places, and did not ſtick to grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95697:140"/>at the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) who to appeaſe them, and to raiſe their droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Courage, reſolved, within a Month after, to give us Battle.</p>
            <p>Every thing ſeem'd to conſpire for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Battle of</hi> Stenkerk, Aug. 3.</note> He was now thirty thouſand Men ſtronger in Inſantry than the Duke of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburgh,</hi> who labour'd alſo under another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency, that his Cannon was left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, his Artillery not arriving till the Night before the Engagement. The Grounds on that ſide where the Enemy intended at At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack us being full of ſmall Bogs and Rivulets, with very thick Hedges and large Ditches, was only fit for the Infantry to Engage in. Here it was that the Troops of the King's Houſhold were poſted, who being cover'd by one ſingle Brigade, (the reſt of the <hi>French</hi> Infantry were at leaſt a League's diſtance from thence) the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> III.) did not in the leaſt queſtion but they would ſoon be over-powered by the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Infantry, that were to begin the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack; all the circumſtances appearing ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable on his ſide, that he thought himſelf aſſured of Victory. To amuſe the Enemies Spies, he iſſued out his Orders the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Engagement, that they ſhould go a Foraging the next Day, which done, he kept all the General Officers of the Army with him in his Tent till ten a Clock at Night, when having ſent them back to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Poſts, the march was begun about half an hour after, to be within ſight of the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:95697:141"/>Camp at break of Day. There appear'd ſo much ſatisfaction and joy both in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Words, that when they arriv'd at the appointed place, without being diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>French,</hi> he ſpoke out a loud to his Soldiers, that they were going to an aſſured Victory, not to fight, but to cut to pieces their Enemies; tho' many were of Opinion, that this aſſurance he gave to his Soldiers of an undoubted Victory, was rather done with an intention to enflame their Courage, than to expreſs his own ſentiments, it being unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, that it was always conſider'd as one of the chiefeſt qualifications belonging to a General, to know how to inſpire his Soldiers with a ſeaſonable aſſurance of Victory. It is more than probable, that if at that inſtant he had led his Army towards the Enemy, his deſign would have ſucceeded; but whilſt he ſtayed for the coming up of the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and Count <hi>Waldeck,</hi> who ſtayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an Hour longer than was expected, the <hi>French</hi> had leiſure given them to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a poſture to receive them. It is in vain to choſe ones time, unleſs it be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the beſt advantage. For in the mean time the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> order'd his beſt Battallions to advance with all ſpeed, who being poſted where the Enemy muſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack us, ſuſtained by the Troops of the King's Houſhold, and theſe again by ſeveral other Bodies of Horſe. The Paſs was ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that not being able to extend our Lines in Front, we were forced to double them.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95697:141"/>For the firſt two hours they fir'd moſt terribly on both Sides, the Battallions advancing ſo near, that they diſcharged their Muſquets croſs one another. The Enemy fir'd more briskly than we for ſome time; they got Ground of us, and made themſelves Maſters of four of our Pieces of Cannon; but the <hi>French</hi> perceiving that their Muſquets were not likely to do the Work, threw them down, and being led only by their Officers, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially by the Princes, the Duke of <hi>Chartres,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> Duke <hi>de Maine,</hi> and others, charged the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy with their Swords in hand, ſo furiouſly, that they forced them to retreat, many of whom were cut in pieces, the reſt ſaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in an adjacent Wood. They were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued for an hour after, and the Field of Battle for a League together, was covered all over with dead Carcaſſes, which in ſome places lay ſix Foot high upon one another. This Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry coſt us two or three Thouſand of our beſt Men, among whom were many Perſons of Merit and Quality; eſpecially the Prince of <hi>Turenue,</hi> eldeſt Son to the Duke of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> who died the day after the Battle, of his Wounds. The loſs of the Enemy amounted to nine Thouſand kill'd upon the ſpot, and as many wounded. We took nine Colours, and ten pieces of Cannon, but only thirteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Priſoners, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> refuſing to ask Quarter.</p>
            <p>It was much about the ſame time that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> made an Irruption into the higher <hi>Dauphine,</hi>

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95697:142"/>had for a conſiderable time before, formed a Project of entring <hi>Dauphine</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> flattering themſelves with hopes, that the new Converts would revolt and join them from all Parts of <hi>France.</hi> To put their ſo long projected Deſign in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial General <hi>Caprara,</hi> joined with their Troops the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> They carried along with them Arms for thirty Thouſand Men, and were provided with Miniſters, who in all places, through which they paſſed, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Sermons to ſow the Seed of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and <hi>Calviniſm</hi> among the People. But they found themſelves entirely miſtaken in their Expectation, the new <hi>Catholicks</hi> being ſo far from ſhewing the leaſt Inclination for a Revolt, that they were the moſt forward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occaſions to do what Miſchief they could to the Enemy, by drawing them into Ambuſhes, and killing without Mercy, all ſuch as they met with ſtragling, or otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd from their main Body. This was the Reaſon why the <hi>Confederates</hi> made but little Progreſs, and their propoſed Conqueſt turn'd to a very ſlender Account. They took <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtre</hi> in three days; <hi>Ambrun</hi> held out ſix, <hi>Gap</hi> being only provided with ten Men to keep the Gates, receiv'd them without the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. <hi>Guilleſtre</hi> is at preſent no more than a Country Town, without any other Defence but two old ruin'd Baſtions. <hi>Ambrun</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſmall City, but defended only by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Wall; But the Beſieged ſupplying the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of their Fortifications by their own Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, defended the Place ſo well, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95697:142"/>nemies were not Maſters of it, but with the Loſs of above fiſteen hundred Men. Thus ended this Expedition of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who being faln ill, and finding his Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably diminiſhed by Sickneſs and Fatigues, repaſſed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> carrying no other Spoils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, but the Bells of <hi>Ambrun</hi> and <hi>Gap.</hi>

            <p>In the beginning of this Spring, our King appearing in Perſon in <hi>Flanders,</hi> it was the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rumour, that he aim'd at <hi>Liege;</hi> but after having given his final Orders concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Operation of the Campaign, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd near thirty thouſand Men, under the Command of the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> to reinforce his Army near the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he return'd into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Maſhal <hi>de Lorge</hi> had in the Month of <hi>May,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh <hi>tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the</hi> French.</note> made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Heidelbergh,</hi> the Capital City of the whole <hi>Palatinate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Enemy could march to its Relief; and after having raſed the Fortifications, both of the City and Caſtle, was marched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Confederate Army on that ſide, and at the approach of the Marſhal, retreated before him; but after the arrival of the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> with the beforementioned Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he entrenched himſelf ſtrongly at a Paſs, which he knew impoſſible to be forced, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to undergo the Inconveniencies of Famine and many Diſtempers, which afflicted his Troops in theſe inacceſſible Places, than to hazard a Battle, or to decamp before the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> for fear he ſhould force him to come to an Engagement.</p>
            <pb n="247" facs="tcp:95697:144"/>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (K. <hi>William</hi> III.) did not entrench himſelf, but kept the open Field in <hi>Flanders,</hi> yet ſo as to avoid all Occaſions of Fighting. The Duke of <hi>Luxenburgh,</hi> who had poſitive Orders from the King, to engage him, fained to march towards <hi>Liege,</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Lines and Redoubts, which ſurround that great City. This ſucceeded according to expectation, for the Confederate Army ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing near to the Duke to be ready to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the City, the Duke marched directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and arrived in ſight of their Camp, about ſix or ſeven a Clock at Night.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (K. <hi>William</hi> III.) was not a little ſurpriſed at the ſuddenneſs of his March; but finding himſelf under a Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſtand an Engagement, the next Day he improv'd thoſe few Hours he had, to his beſt Advantage, in putting his Troops in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Battle, raiſing Batteries in conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Places; in fixing Palliſadoes at the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues leading to his Camp; he cauſed two Villages, which covered his Right and Left to be Fortified, and lin'd the Houſes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Hedges with his beſt Infantry; and ſtrengthned his Front, which reached to, and took up all the Ground betwixt theſe two Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages: He employed a great number of Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers all the Night long, in making a Ditch ſix Foot broad, and three quarters of a League long, ſtrengthned without with good Palliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and defended within by a good Line, and Redoubts, upon which were mounted near a hundred pieces of Cannon. The main Body ſtood behind this Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuſtained by the Cavalry, which
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95697:145"/>was poſted behind them in two Lines. They were the fineſt Troops that could be ſeen. On the other hand, is it poſſible to imagine, that our Soldiers could be ſo courageous, or rather Fool-hardy enough to attempt the attacking of ſixty thouſand brave Men, guarded by ſuch ſtrong Entrenchments.</p>
            <p>The great Artillery began to play at break of Day,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Battle of</hi> Neerwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. 29. July.</note> on both ſides without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, till four a Clock in the Afternoon. That of the Enemies did great Execution among us, being placed upon an Eminency, which commanded the Plain. The oldeſt Officers did acknowledge never to have ſeen Cannon to play with ſo much Fury, and at ſo little a diſtance, for ſo long a time together, which at a diſtance reſembled more a Sea-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, than a Field-Battle. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies fired more frequently than we, and their Artillery did much more Execution, ſo that this Victory muſt be meerly aſcribed to the invincible Courage of our Soldiery; and it muſt be acknowledged, that <hi>Philip,</hi> Duke <hi>de Chartres,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and <hi>de Maine,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and the Count de <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,</hi> had a great ſhare in the Succeſs of this Day. There was not a Battallion in both the Army's but what was Engaged in the Battle; but the chief Attack was at a Village, call'd <hi>Neerwinden,</hi> which covered the Right Wing. This Village was taken and retaken twice with great Slaughter; till at laſt our Troops, having maintained and ſtrengthned themſelves in this Poſt, they entred the Plain, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the Enemy both in Front and Flank, who received us very Courageouſly, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:95697:145"/>the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the main Body, who Charged ſix times with incredible Bravery; but their Cavalry being brought into Confuſion, and drove into a River, the whole Army begun to diſperſe, and to quit the Field by whole Troops and Companies, leaving the Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enemy Maſter of the Field, with three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ſixteen pieces of Cannon, eight Mortars, nine Patteroons, twelve pair of Kettle-Drums, abundance of Arms, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Standards, two and twenty Colours, and above two thouſand Priſoners, among whom were two hundred Officers. The <hi>French</hi> loſt above three thouſand Men killed, and four thouſand wounded. The Loſs of the Enemy amounted to near twenty thouſand Men, both in the Engagement and Flight, there being a great number drown'd in endeavouring to Ford the River, which for a conſiderable time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was rendred paſſable by the Bridges made by the dead Carcaſſes of Men and Horſes. This vaſt Army was diſperſed in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they could not get together in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy again till ſix days after, when being rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with freſh Troops; and eſpecially with the Detachment commanded by the Prince of <hi>Wirtembergh,</hi> they appear'd again in the Field.</p>
            <p>It is to be taken notice of here, that ſince the beginning of this War, our King had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered certain Lines or Entrenchments to be made from <hi>Mabeuge</hi> to the Sea-ſide, to ſerve as a Barricado to cover his Conqueſts on that ſide. The Duke of <hi>Wirtembergh</hi> having been detached from the main Army with a Body three times ſtronger than the <hi>French,</hi> that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:95697:146"/>guarded theſe Lines to attack them, had forced theſe Entrenchments, and was juſt then preparing to ravage the Country, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the News of this Defeat he was forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to turn back in order to join with all ſpeed the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.)</p>
            <p>Within two Months after,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Victory of</hi> Marſaglia <hi>the</hi> 4 O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctober.</note> the Marſhal <hi>de Catinat</hi> obtained another no leſs compleat, but leſs bloody Victory over the Confederate Army in <hi>Italy,</hi> under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The ſaid Marſhal's Army had hitherto been much inferior in Number to the Allies, which was the Reaſon that he had not undertaken any thing of moment, but only to obſerve the Enemies Motions, and to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs them with Marches and Countermarches. The Duke and <hi>Spaniards</hi> willing to improve this Opportunity, reſolved to beſiege <hi>Pignerol;</hi> but being diſcouraged by the Reſiſtance they met with in the Taking of St. <hi>Brigitt,</hi> which being built but a Year before, at ſome diſtance from the Town, commanded the chief Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues leading to it, and had held out fifteen days before it was taken; they altered their Reſolutions, contenting themſelves with throwing a vaſt number of Bombs and red hot Bullets into the Place. Whilſt they were flattering themſelves with the hopes of either reducing or deſtroying the City of <hi>Pignerol</hi> by Fire, Meſſengers after Meſſengers came to bring the ſad News to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that not only the <hi>French</hi> had burnt one of his Country Houſes, but that alſo the Marſhal <hi>de Catinat,</hi> having received a Conſiderable Reinforcement, had made himſelf Maſter of the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95697:146"/>Plains. The Duke immediately directing his March towards thoſe Plains, he was met by the Marſhal. The Battle began about nine a Clock in the Forenoon; the right Wing of the Enemy was brought into confuſion at the firſt Encounter, the left follow'd not long after the Example of the right Wing, yet they Rallyed, and return'd to the Charge twice or thrice, but without any great Effect, for their Cavalry being entirely routed, the reſt were cut to pieces, except thoſe who ſaved themſelves by flight; and to fly with the leſs Inconveniency, threw away their Arms, enough to Arm ſixteen thouſand Men. The flying Enemy were purſued to the very Gates of <hi>Turin,</hi> the whole Plain being cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with dead Carcaſſes, and in ſome places with entire Battallions, eſpecially of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> and <hi>Hugonots.</hi> The Enemies loſt nine thouſand Men in this Engagement, beſides two thouſand taken Priſoners, a hundred Colours, forty five Standards, and thirty four pieces of Cannon. We had twelve or fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred killed and wounded on our ſide. The <hi>Gens d'Arms</hi> behaved themſelves to a miracle; Our Infantry fought with their Bayonets in their Fuſzees and Sword in hand. After the Loſs of this Battle, the Duke being reinforced with the <hi>German</hi> Troops that block'd up <hi>Caſal,</hi> yet durſt not appear in the Field; ſo that the Marſhal <hi>de Catinat,</hi> without oppoſition, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run all the flat Country, and carried away a prodigious quantity of Proviſion.</p>
            <p>The King received the News of this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of the Surrender of <hi>Charleroy</hi> in one day. This place is ſituate betwixt <hi>Mons</hi> and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95697:147"/>
               <hi>Namur,</hi> and was beſieged in <hi>November,</hi> when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (K. <hi>William</hi> III.) was juſt ready to paſs over into <hi>England;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Charleroy</note> but upon the News of this Siege return'd into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and advanced with an Army as far as <hi>Bruſsels,</hi> but did not attempt the Relief of the Place, which, tho' conſiderable for its ſtrength, was forced to ſurrender in ſix and twenty days.</p>
            <p>About the end of the ſame Month,
<note place="margin">Engliſh <hi>Expedition againſt St.</hi> Malo.</note> an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Squadron was ſent towards St. <hi>Malo,</hi> to attempt the deſtruction of that Place, not ſo much by their Bombs, as a certain Engine, by which they hoped to blow up that City, or to lay it in Aſhes. This Engine was a three Deck'd-Ship, of about four hundred Tuns, lined and vaulted within with Brick-Work. Betwixt each of theſe Decks, there were placed many Barrels with Gun-powder, mixt with a certain Compoſition of Tarr, Pitch, and Roſin, a great number of Bombs, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes, and other Casks, fill'd with all ſorts of Combuſtible Matter. It was a fair and clear Night, very calm and Spring-tide, when this infernal Engine came ſwimming up with the Tide, but by good Fortune was forced upon a Rock, within Piſtol-ſhot of the Walls of the City. The Engineer, who had the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Veſſel, perceiving that ſhe took Water was ſo over-haſty in ſetting her on Fire, that both He and his Attendants were blown up in the ſame moment, before they had time to get out of reach. The ſpringing of this Engine made a moſt dreadful Noiſe, and ſhook all the circumjacent Ground for three or four Leagues; The whole City felt a moſt violent Confuſion, and in a moment all the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:95697:147"/>Streets were covered with Slates and Tyles, which, like a Shower of Hail, powred down from the tops of the Houſes. This was the whole Loſs ſuſtained by this dreadful Engine, which carried along with it, more Terror than Damage, there being not one Houſe in the whole City that receiv'd any further Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, neither was there one ſingle Perſon kill'd or wounded. For the Powder having taken vent, and being beſides that, ſpoil'd by the Water, did not anſwer the pretended Effect in throwing the Bombs and Barrels full of Combuſtible Matter into the Air. At low Water, near ſeven hundred Bombs were taken up from the Sands, and abundance of Powder out of the Wrack of the Veſſel.</p>
            <p>We could ſcarce have wiſh'd for a more proſperous Campaign on our ſide than the laſt;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Campaign in</hi> 1694.</note> but as there is no human Felicity without ſome mixture of Adverſity; ſo when the State ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers within, all its outward Proſperity appears to be but ſuperficial. I ſay, we could not have wiſhed for a more glorious Campaign, if a general Scarcity had not almoſt ruined ſeveral Provinces in the Kingdom; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> with the circumja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Parts. <hi>France</hi> is a very fertile Country, abounding eſpecially in Wheat, ſo as to be able to furniſh its Neighbours with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Quantity of this uſeful Commodity; which, for ſeveral years before had been ſo cheap, that the common People liv'd eaſie enough, tho' by reaſon of the long War, and the decay of Trade, there was but ſlender Gain among them. But the Harveſt in the Year 1693, both for quantity and quality of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:95697:148"/>the Corn prov'd ſo exceſſive bad, that it was ſold for four times the Price than before. In this unhappy Conjuncture, the King ſent a great number of Ships, both to the North, and the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dearth in</hi> France.</note> to ſupply our Wants; he obliged the Corn-Merchants to carry their Stores to Market, to furniſh the Country with Seed for the next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Year; he cauſed a great quantity of Bread to be deſtributed to the poorer Sort, at half the price it coſt him, and gave every Week a good Sum for the Suſtenance of the Poor of each Pariſh. To theſe Supplies and human Aids, he join'd the Prayers of the Church, and God was pleaſed ſo to bleſs his Endeavours, that his Subjects were ſoon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, and freed from their preſent Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, the next Harveſt proving ſo plentiful, that within five Weeks time, the Price of Corn fell to ſuch a degree, that it was ſold at the ſame rate, as before the time of the Dearth.</p>
            <p>This general Scarcity however (the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fore-runner of a great Mortality) was a ſufficient In ducement to perſwade the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (K. <hi>William</hi> III.) that this was the moſt ſeaſonable Juncture that could offer to Invade the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> The Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates encouraged by the hopes of Succeſs, augmented their Forces on all ſides with freſh Troops; and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who ever ſince the beginning of this War had not been ſparing of their Money, being now more liberal than ever in granting new Supplies, he Equipp'd two Fleets to back his Deſign. But the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was in no wiſe anſwerable to theſe vaſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95697:148"/>Preparations. For in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> the Campaign paſſed without any Siege or Action of Moment. In <hi>Germany</hi> the Confederate Army had paſſed the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in order to ravage the <hi>Lower Alſace,</hi> but no ſooner did the Marſhal <hi>de Lorge</hi> march againſt them, but they re-paſs'd the ſaid River without any further Action.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dauphin</hi> Commanded at that time in <hi>Flanders,</hi> attended by the Flower of all the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, his Army was compoſed of the beſt Troops, but did not exceed fifty thouſand Men. The Confederate Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of fourſcore thouſand Men, under the Command of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (K. <hi>William</hi> III.) and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> and it was given out that they intended to Beſiege <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> but notwithſtanding the inequality of their Number, there paſſed not any thing of Moment all this Campaign.</p>
            <p>Towards the latter end of the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Confederate Army decamped from about <hi>Liege,</hi> directing their March to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Lines, in hopes to force them, and to put our Conqueſts under Contribution, and to open the way for ſome Enterprize of more moment. To put the Deſign in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, they advanced towards the <hi>Shelde,</hi> in hopes to be able to lay their Bridges over that River without much oppoſition, there being not above ſeven or eight thouſand Men, (as they imagined) to guard our Lines; But their Aſtoniſhment was ſuch, as is paſs'd all Expreſſion, when they ſaw on the other ſide of the River ſeveral Batteries mounted with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Army ranged in Battle-Array, ready to receive them. It was a good
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:95697:149"/>while before they could believe their own Eyes, thinking it impoſſible, that, whereas they had got two days march before the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> and the Road they had taken was by one half ſhorter, they ſhould be prevented by the <hi>French</hi> Army, which had many Defiles, and four Rivers to paſs. For, no ſooner had the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> receiv'd Intelligence of their March, but he immediately diſpatch'd his Orders, to get every thing in readineſs upon the Road, which might conduce towards the haſty March of his Army, to prevent, if poſſible, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Deſign. His Orders were ſo ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that in all places through which they paſſed, they found Forrage, Proviſions, and all other Refreſhments in abundance, many Bridges were laid ready over the Rivers, great Numbers of Waggons and Boats attended every where, to carry the Soldiers that were unable to follow the reſt, or to convey theſe with more Expedition, who were intended to be the firſt, that ſhould join theſe Forces that kept the Guard of the Lines. Never were any Solders ſeen to March with more Alacrity. Neither the Weight of their Arms, nor the Heat of the Seaſon, nor the Fatigues of ſo long and Expeditious a March, did abate the leaſt of their Vigour and Activity; they ſtrove on the contrary to out-viegh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their March, aiding and encouraging thoſe who ſtaid a little behind. This gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Emulation prov'd ſo ſucceſsful, that the whole Army, with their Cannon and Baggage, march'd forty large Leagues in leſs than four days time. The Confederate Army was ſo much ſurpriſed at this unexpected Sight, that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95697:149"/>they retired immediately without attempting any thing further, that Campaign; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went into Winter quarters, they ſent a ſtrong Detatchment towards <hi>Liege,</hi> which in conjunction with the Forces of that Biſhoprick, took the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Huy</hi> in ſix days, a ſmall place; and one of thoſe, that commonly fall to the ſhare of thoſe, who are Maſters of the Field. Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore pieces of Cannon, and thirty Mortars were made uſe of in this Siege; an Expence ſuitable to a much greater Enterprize, but ſcarce worth the taking of a Place of ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Conſequence.</p>
            <p>The Conqueſt of <hi>Huy</hi> ſeem'd to be but a ſlender Recompence to the Allies; for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments of this Compaign, which had paſſed without any Action of moment, and for the loſs of a Battle, and four conſiderable Places in <hi>Catalonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Marſhal <hi>de Noailles,</hi> having imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his arrival in thoſe Parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the King's Orders, to find out, and fight the Enemy, he found them entrenched to the number of ſixteen or ſeventeen thouſand on the oppoſite ſhoar of the River <hi>Ter,</hi> which is pretty broad, but fordable in many places. The <hi>French</hi> Army was not inferior to that of the Enemy,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Battle near</hi> Ter. 27 May.</note> conſiſting of twelve thouſand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Troops, the reſt of the Militia. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Squadrons of Granadiers, and of the Carabiniers, having thrown themſelves with break of day into the River, ſome with only their Swords in hand, the reſt with their Fuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees and Bayonets; the Enemy fired very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly upon them; notwithſtanding which,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95697:150"/>they advanced with an undaunted Courage, and attack'd them with ſo much Bravery, that they entring Pall-mall with them in their Camp, forced them to quit their Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In the mean while, the beſt of the whole Army, having paſſed the River, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in good Order to give them Battle. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe received them with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Courage, whereby their Infantry got leiſure to retire. The Cavalry was brought ſeveral times into confuſion, and Rally'd as often, till at laſt being quite broken, moſt of them were cut to pieces, they being purſued for three Hours together to the Defiles. A good part of the Infantry underwent the ſame Fate; ſo that we obtained a compleat Victory, with the loſs of only two or three hundred Men on our ſide. The Enemies had betwixt four or five thouſand kill'd and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and we took above three thouſand Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, all their Baggage, Proviſion, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and ſixteen Colours. Immediately after the gaining of the Battle,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Palamos.</note> the Marſhal <hi>de Noailles</hi> beſieged <hi>Palamos,</hi> a ſmall Maritime Town, but well fortified. There was a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of three thouſand Men in the place, which did defend themſelves only five days after the Place began to be Batter'd by our Cannon, both by Sea and Land. For whilſt the Marſhal attack'd it by Land, a <hi>French</hi> Squadron of Men of War, batter'd it by Sea. After we had made our ſelves Maſters of the Counterſcarp, there were two Breaches in the Wall, but ſo narrow, that not above one Man could mount it at a time in Front; Some Soldiers having taken notice of it, ſhew'd it to their Officers,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:95697:150"/>who approving of their Deſign, they moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Breach, entred the City, and taking advantage of the general Conſternation; this unexpected Sight of the Enemy upon the Ramparts, had put them into, they ſoon made themſelves Maſters of the City, on the 7th of <hi>June:</hi> The Fort or Caſtle, being forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Surrender at Diſcretion, within three days after; the Marſhal, without looſing time, ſat down before <hi>Gironne</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Place was ſo conſiderable for its Strength, that in the Year 1684,
<note place="margin">Gironne <hi>taken.</hi>
               </note> it obliged the <hi>French</hi> Army to raiſe the Siege. But our late Victory near the River <hi>Ter,</hi> the taking of <hi>Palamos,</hi> the furious diſcharges of our Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the vaſt number of our Bombs, which did great Execution, and ſet the Town on fire; beſides the little hopes there was of being relieved, obliged the Inhabitants and Garriſon to Capitulate in five days. We made our ſelves Maſters of ſeveral other places betwixt <hi>Gironne</hi> and <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and all the Country round was ſeiſed with ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, that their Capital City it ſelf would ſcarce have been able to hold out a Week againſt our victorious Arms, if the Heats had not been ſo exceſſive, as to prevent us from undertaking the Siege; and the Confederate Fleet was ſo ſeaſonably to their Aſſiſtance, and had ſupply'd them both with Ammunition and Men. This was the only Fruit they reap'd from the Equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo numerous a Fleet, it being fear'd otherwiſe, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a ſeparate Peace with us, if they had not come to their Relief; It was alſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95697:151"/>that at the Sollicitations of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> this Fleet was to endeavour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining of <hi>Villa Franca.</hi> It was compoſed of one hundred and thirty Sail, among which were threeſcore and fifteen for the Line of Battle.

There were alſo ſome who pretended that they were to chaſtiſe <hi>Genove,</hi> for refuſing to join with the Confederacy. But all theſe Projects vaniſhed into Smoak, they being diſenabled for want of Proviſions, and by the many Diſtempers that reigned among the Seamen, to undertake any thing of moment; they kept the Sea for ſome time after, till the approaching Winter Seaſon forced them to ſeek for a ſafe Retreat in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ports.</p>
            <p>Their Fleet in the Ocean made more Noiſe, but did not much more Damage.

In <hi>Holland,</hi> the common People cry'd out aloud for Peace, in <hi>London,</hi> tho' they did not do it ſo publickly, yet they were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of it. The Parliament took an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Supplies granted for the uſe of the War, and what Share each of the Allies ought to have in the Expences, purſuant to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:95697:152"/>the Treaty's, concluded for that purpoſe. They excluded the <hi>Speaker</hi> of the Houſe of Commons from their Houſe, and impriſon'd ſeveral of their Members.

                  <hi>Queen of</hi> Englands <hi>Death.</hi>
               </note> King <hi>James</hi>'s Party began to appear more formidable than before; and that the Differences betwixt the Court and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> only Siſter of the deceaſed Princeſs (Q. <hi>Mary</hi>) might furniſh them with an opportunity to Foment the inteſtine Diviſions in that Kingdom; or that perhaps ſome of the Confederates, diſcouraged by the change of Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> might not proſecute the War with the ſame Vigour as before. But it was not long before theſe Hopes were fruſtrated in the end. For the Prince (K. <hi>William</hi> III.) either by his good Fortune or Conduct, prevented all theſe Dangers, there being not the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any Commotion. On the contrary, he ſhew'd ſuch an unparallell'd Reſolution in the whole management of his Affairs at that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:95697:152"/>time, that he ſeem'd to bid Defiance to all Dangers, and inſpite of all the Intrigues, and the Hazard of quitting the Helm, at ſo criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal a Juncture; he paſſed over into <hi>Flanders</hi> in the next Spring; to encourage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote by his Preſence, the Zeal of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Princes, who having augmented their Forces, made all imaginable Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to attack us with more Vigour than ever.</p>
            <p>According to the meaſures concerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Confederates, they were to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take three ſeveral Sieges at once; one in <hi>Flanders,</hi> another in <hi>Italy,</hi> and a third in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia,</hi> whilſt two good Fleets were to Alarm our Coaſts, and to deſtroy our Sea-Port Towns. It muſt be confeſs'd, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates were at preſent in a much better Condition than ever ſince the beginning of the War, to undertake ſomething of Moment to raiſe the drooping Courage of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and it muſt alſo be allow'd, that they were more ſucceſsful this Campaign than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' at the ſame time, they ſucceeded but in one of theſe three. For the <hi>Germans</hi> were not in a capacity to act offenſively, having been much diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by ſeveral large Detachments, ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce their Army's in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> beſieged <hi>Caſtle Follit</hi> in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> but at the approach of the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> who Commanded inſtead of the Marſhal <hi>de Noailles,</hi> who was faln ſick at the opening of the Campaign, they quitted the Siege.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of the Summer, they ſat down before <hi>Palamos,</hi> but with no better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, for after five days of opening the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:95697:153"/>Trenches, they raiſed the Siege, upon notice that the Duke was marching againſt them.</p>
            <p>For theſe two years paſt, the Emperour and <hi>Spain</hi> had preſs'd the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to lay Siege to <hi>Caſal,</hi> a Place ſituate upon the River <hi>Po;</hi> and ſo conſiderable for its advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Situation, betwixt <hi>Savoy</hi> and the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneze,</hi> the Petty Principalities of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua, Modena,</hi> and <hi>Parma.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> (who within fifty or ſixty years have beſieged this Place five ſeveral times) have for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time been very ambitious of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſters of this Place, which for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Situation would open to them the way to the Conqueſt of all <hi>Italy.</hi> The Emperour's Deſign being founded upon the ſame Maxim, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> for fear of endangering his own Liberty, had hitherto refuſed to join with them in the Siege of this Place. But the Council at <hi>Viena</hi> having at laſt found Means, to remove all Jealouſy, perſwaded the Duke to conſent to it. Accordingly they made prodigious Preparations for the carrying on of this Siege, and that with ſo much Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Caſal.</note> that the Lines and Batteries were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the Month of <hi>April.</hi> But the firſt Attempt prov'd fruitleſs, the Snows and cold Seaſon having obliged the Confederate Army to return to their Winter Quarters; ſo that the Siege was not renew'd till five Weeks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The neighbouring <hi>Italian</hi> Princes find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to perſiſt in their Reſolution, were extreamly Alarm'd at it, being ſenſible that the Emperour, who had already under the Pretext of providing his Forces with Winter Quarters, got a footing in <hi>Italy,</hi> would by the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:95697:153"/>Conqueſt of a Place of ſuch Conſequence, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen himſelf a way into <hi>Italy.</hi> To ward this Blow, theſe Princes took a Reſolution, either to endeavour to oblige the Allies to deſiſt from this Attempt, or elſe to intercede with our King to reſtore the ſaid Place to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> with its Fortifications raſed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Condition that he ſhould be reimburſed what this Place had coſt him; for which the ſaid Princes engaged themſelves to be Guarantees. The King had bought this place for five Millions of Livres, and it had coſt him three more ſince, without reaping any other Advantage by it, than to be ready at hand to ſuccour the Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> whereas we were obliged to maintain in it a conſtant Garriſon of our beſt Troops, who might be better employed elſewhere. The King having well weighed the Matter, and that our Army in <hi>Piedmont</hi> was at that time not ſtrong enough to engage the Enemy, or to oblige them to raiſe the Siege, rather accepted their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to raſe the Fortifications of the Place, than to ſacrifiſe four or five thouſand Men in the defence of it. The <hi>Swiſs Cantons,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> having prevail'd with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to conſent to this Treaty, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and <hi>Spain</hi> were obliged to accept of the ſame Terms.

            <p>Whilſt the Confederates were before <hi>Caſal,</hi> the Grand Confederate Fleet, which had been this Winter in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ports, appear'd
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:95697:154"/>continually upon the Coſt of <hi>Provence,</hi> to oblige our King to employ part of his Forces for the defence of his Sea-Coaſts on that ſide, and conſequently prevent the ſending of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to <hi>Caſal.</hi> The Fleet was but in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Condition by reaſon of the great Mortality among the Seamen, occaſioned by the want of freſh Proviſions, and many other Neceſſaries, which they could not be furniſhed withal, but from <hi>England;</hi> yet they appear'd ſo formidable, that it was given out they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Bombard <hi>Thoulon</hi> and <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> but knowing us to be ready to give them a warm Reception, they did not think fit to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it. They were cruiſing the reſt of the Summer in the Gulph of <hi>Lyons,</hi> in the Seas of <hi>Cardaigne</hi> and <hi>Liguria;</hi> and having been over-taken by a moſt violent Storm, in which they loſt five of their great Ships, they came to an Anchor before <hi>Palamos;</hi> Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Intelligence that we began to equip at <hi>Thoulon,</hi> they choſe the open Sea, cruiſing from one Place to another, without any other Deſign than to pick up now and then ſome of our Privateers, and to diſturb our Commerce.</p>
            <p>The Second Fleet of the Confederates in the Ocean conſiſted of Thirty great Ships,

But <hi>Dunkirk</hi> being the Place which the Enemy aim'd at, they were
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95697:154"/>ſo well prepared for their Reception, that they appear'd rather like Men, with hopes of a Victory, than diſcourag'd with fear at the Approach of an Enemy; the entrance of the Harbour being well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Batteries, with Chains, and a good number of Chaloops full of armed Men, commanded by our beſt Marine Officers.

Four Fireſhips approached the wooden Forts that defend the Mole, but were met by the Chaloops, who blew them up into the Air, in the open Sea, in the Sight of the People; the ſame Chaloops alſo boarded and took one of their great Ships, which they ſet on Fire. They threw in all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt eleven and twelve Hundred Bombs, which did ſo little damage that it might be all repair'd for thirty Piſtols.</p>
            <p>In hopes of better Succeſs,

                  <hi>Calais</hi> Bombard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> the ſame Fleet Bombarded <hi>Calais</hi> twice in the Month of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> But the loſs ſuſtain'd by both theſe Bombardments did ſcarce amount to ten thouſand Crowns. Another convincing Inſtance of what we ſaid before, that their Enterprizes at Sea ſucceed but ſeldom, and that they rarely prove anſwerable to the vaſtneſs of their Expences.</p>
            <p>The main effort of this Campaign, as well as of moſt of the others, was made on the ſide of <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Armies Encamped ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry numerous in the Field on both ſides, and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95697:155"/>thirty Thouſand brave Fellows loſt their Lives, without coming to a Field Battle. For theſe three years laſt paſt the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates had formed a Deſign to attack our Lines, to ravage our Conqueſts, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> To prevent their Deſign, the King ordered new Lines to be made from the <hi>Schelde</hi> to the <hi>Lis,</hi> and from <hi>Courtray</hi> to the Sea-ſide. Twenty Thouſand Pioneers made a Ditch of fourteen Thouſand Foot long, fifteen Foot broad, and twelve Foot deep, with an Entrenchment behind it of ten Foot high, in leſs than eight days time. Theſe Lines being a freſh Obſtacle to the deſign of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> III.) he aſſembled the Confederate Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with all poſſible diligence near <hi>Ipres,</hi> to endeavour to obſtruct the Perfecting of this Work, the Lines on that ſide being not quite brought to Perfection. Our Army was above five and twenty Thouſand Men inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in number to theirs, and much haraſſed by a long March of twice four and twenty hours, and conſequently not in a condition, without taking ſome repoſe, to make any conſiderable reſiſtance; beſides that, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one half of their Train of Artillery was arrived in the Camp. The Confederate Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my conſiſted of above an Hundred Thouſand Men, all freſh Troops, provided with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Train of Artillery, ſo that every thing ſeemed to concurr to their advantage; but they let ſlip the opportunity of attacking us at the right nick of time; for in a few hours after our Cannon arrived in the Camp, and our Troops having refreſhed themſelves a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95697:155"/>little, the Lines were brought to Perfection the next following Night.</p>
            <p>Thus having miſs'd their aim, they made an attempt upon <hi>Fort Knock,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Attack of Fort Knock.</note> which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked three ſeveral times, and were as often repulſed, with the loſs of two Thouſand Men, ſo that in eight days time they had not got an Inch of Ground. But a little time convinc'd the World that a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Deſign was carrying on under the pretence of this Attack. For in the mean while the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) had ſent ſome of his beſt Troops towards the <hi>Meſue,</hi> and ſo ſoon as he had received advice that the Troops of <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> had inveſted <hi>Namur,</hi> he and the Elector of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> followed in Perſon, with the reſt of the Army to aſſiſt at the Siege, leaving only thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thouſand Men under the Command of the Prince of <hi>Vaudemont</hi> in the <hi>Lower Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Namur</hi> was ſo well provided with every thing neceſſary for its defence, that it was not queſtioned but it would make a long and vigorous reſiſtance. <hi>Lewis Francis,</hi> Marſhal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> had thrown himſelf into the place the ſame day it was Inveſted. There was a Garriſon in it of ten Thouſand eight hundred Men, many good Officers, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of brave Volunteers, and Ammunition more than was requiſite for its defence; all which advantages appeared to be ſuch obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to the Enemies, that moſt were of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion they would be too many for them to ſurmount, and that they would be forced to quit this Enterprize.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:95697:156"/>The Marſhal <hi>de Luxenburgh</hi> died in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>January</hi> of a Pleuriſie,

            <p>The King having received news of the Siege, ſent his Orders to <hi>Francis de Neuville Villeroy,</hi> Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> who ſuceeded the Duke of <hi>Luxenburgh</hi> in the Command of the Grand Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to enter the <hi>Lower Flanders,</hi> and if poſſible, to fight the Prince of <hi>Vaudemont.</hi>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:95697:156"/>beſides which, we found the Magazine as full of all ſorts of Ammunition, and this part of the Country having been preſerved on purpoſe by the Confederates, our Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers got an incredible Booty.</p>
            <p>By the Conqueſt of the two Places, our Forces having open'd themſelves the wayto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ghent</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> the <hi>Flemmings</hi> as well as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were extreamly allarm'd at it, eſpecially when they ſaw them advance but ſlowly in the Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> tho' they were plentifully provided with every thing for a vigorous Attack, and that they had the advantage of very fair Weather, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as at the time when we beſieged it, our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were not only to fight againſt the brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Garriſon, but alſo againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of a Rainy and Stormy Seaſon. They had raiſed before it thirty Batteries, upon which were mounted an Hundred and thirty pieces of Cannon,

This dreadful Artillery play'd without Intermiſſion againſt the Place, as long as the Siege laſted, in which they conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three Millions of Powder. Their Army was very formidable, and conſtantly rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd with freſh Troops; what Place is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hold out againſt ſuch an Attack? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe Advantages, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates could not be Maſters of the whole, till after a Siege of two Months, the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, like brave Soldiers, diſputing with them every Inch of Ground. Of this we ſaw an Inſtance at the taking of the Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were made only in haſte at ſome diſtance from the Town, to hinder the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95697:157"/>approach of an Enemy. Monſieur <hi>de Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi> who commanded them in Chief, made ſo many Sallies as fill'd up their Trenches, threw up whole Battallions by the ſpringing of his Mines, into the Air, that it coſt the Enemy eight days time before they could make themſelves Maſters of them, after they had been repulſed in the firſt Aſſault, and that the <hi>French</hi> had been reduc'd to theſe ſtreights as not to have room enough left to make new Entrenchments.
<note place="margin">The Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es opened before <hi>Namur,</hi> betwixt the 11th and 12th of July.</note> The City did not Capitulate till after four and twenty days of opening of the Trenches, all their covert ways, and other Outworks being ſo entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruin'd by the Enemies great Artillery, that without the utmoſt hazard they could not pretend to ſuſtain a third Aſſault. The firſt aſſault was the moſt terrible that had been ſeen in the Memory of Man, it being no leſs obſtinate than bloody. It was a moſt dreadful Sight to behold the dead Carcaſſes lying in great Heaps, and to hear the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Groans and Cries of the dying and wounded Soldiers. The Allies renew'd the Attack four ſeveral times, without being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lodge themſelves within either of the Trenches, though all the ſame time theſe were ſeconded by a ſhower of Carcaſſes, Bombs,

            <p>This brave Reſiſtance giving us all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable hopes that the Caſtle would be able to defend it ſelf much longer, the Marſhal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> advanc'd with his Army towards <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to Bombard that Place, unleſs the Confederades would agree not to Bombard

At the end of a great Cauſey (the only way by which we could approach the Town,) the Enemies had made an Entrenchment of twenty Foot high, having before it a low way, which ſerved for a Ditch. But all theſe Obſtacles were not ſufficient to hinder the Marſhal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> from opening his Trenches, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Batteries in ſpite of all their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, neither the Garriſon, or of Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>'s Army which laid En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched on the backſide of the Town, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the leaſt Motion, either at our Arrival before, or at our Marching off from before the Place. All the Batteries being ready to Play, the Marſhal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> ſent his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, of not Bombarding any Place for the future without a formal Siege. But the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> whoſe Intention was to gain time, being come to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the Marſhal threw four Thouſand Bombs in three Nights time into the Place. 'Tis impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Confuſion and Terrour occaſioned by the fury of our Bombs in ſo populous a City. The beſt and ſtrongeſt Edifices being deſtroyed, and two thirds of the whole City
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:95697:158"/>either Burnt, or laid Level to the Ground.</p>
            <p>From hence our Army Marched towards <hi>Namur.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> III) having received Intelligence of their Approach, and being joined by the Prince of <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> and another Re-inforcement drew up his whole Army behind his Lines, leaving only Twenty Thouſand Men to guard the Trenches, with a Reſolution to avoid Fighting as long as poſſible he could, and to keep on the Defenſive, being cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all ſides by unpaſſable Boggs, thick Wood and Hedges, and defended by dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Entrenchments at all the Avenues. The Marſhal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> left nothing unattempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this Occaſion; he himſelf went in Perſon to take a View of the Woods and Defiles, to ſee whether by ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were not poſſible to force the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Quarters without too much expoſing the Soldiers to the Slaughter, but found all the Avenues ſo well ſecur'd, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to attack the Enemy,</p>
            <p>All the hopes of Relief being cut off by the Retreat of the <hi>French</hi> Army. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates attack'd the Caſtle with new Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. Their great Artillery had done ſuch terrible Execution againſt the Caſtle, that all the Out-works appear'd no otherwiſe than like ſo many heaps of Stone or Rubbiſh, the poor Soldiers being for the moſt part forced to ſhelter themſelves in the Vaults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fury of the Bombs and Bullets which made Breaches every where, each of which was big enough for a whole Battallion to Mount in Front. The Marſhal <hi>de Boufleurs</hi>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:95697:158"/>having refuſed to hearken to the Summons ſent him by the Confederates, they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a general Aſſault, which was made in eleven ſeveral places at once.</p>
            <p>The day appointed for this Bloody Action being come, the Beſieged ſaw about ten a Clock in the Morning the Enemies In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry appear in two Columns above the Trenches, advancing in good order to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Breaches. Three Thouſand of their beſt Men, at the Head of whom were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Granadiers, did out-brave all the reſt in attempting to mount the Breach made in the Body of the Caſtle. There was at leaſt ſix Hundred Yards diſtance betwixt the head of the Trenches and the ſaid Breach, defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both ſides with ſeveral Out works, well provided with a ſufficient number of Soldiers But thoſe brave Fellows made their way thro' all theſe Obſtacles, and advanced ſo briskly in ſpight of the Enemies Fire, which galled them ſo in Front and Flank, that the firſt Battallion planted their Colours on the top of the Breach. This Battallion being brought into Confuſion by the irreſiſtible Bravery of the Beſieged, the ſecond took their place, till being quite broken as well as the former, the flying Soldiers preſſing upon one another, brought the reſt that were to Second them likewiſe in Coufuſion, who thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in great diſorder. All the other Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults were made and repulſed with the ſame Bravery, notwithſtanding the Garriſon was quite exhauſted of Strength by the continual Fatigues, and for want of Reſt; but being animated by the Example of the Marſhal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:95697:159"/>and the reſt of the Officers, who alſo remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to them that the Honour of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid at Stake, and that their ſafety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended only on the points of their Swords; they gave ſuch Signal Proofs of their Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Enemies were repulſed in all their Attacks with great Slaughter, which laſted till five a Clock in the Afternoon. This was a moſt glorious day for the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but they had loſt ſo many of their Men in this occaſion, that finding themſelves not in a Capacity to ſuſtain another Aſſault, the Marſhal <hi>de Bouflers</hi> was forc'd to Capitulate,
<note place="margin">The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd.</note> and to ſurrender the Caſtle on the firſt day of <hi>November. Namur</hi> was purchaſed at a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dear rate by the Confederates, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the immenſe Expences beſtowed in the carrying on of this Siege, loſt twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, the Flower of their whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>The Confederates being fluſh'd with this Succeſs,
<note place="margin">Campaign 1666.</note> boaſted every where of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, but the wiſer ſort among them were not much overjoyed at this Advantage, as looking upon it as a means to retard the concluſion of a Peace. For the People being exhauſted with Taxes, wiſhed very earneſtly for a Peace, as the only means to free them from thoſe heavy Impoſitions. Their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce was conſiderably diminiſhed, our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers, who continually infeſted their Coaſts, taking ſome of them every Day; it having been Computed, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> alone have ſince the beginning of this War, loſt four Thouſand two Hundred Merchant Men, valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themſelves at thirty Millions of Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:95697:159"/>But there appeared in <hi>England</hi> many other Cauſes of Inteſtine Diviſions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. For the Money began to be very ſcarce, and was ſo much Clipp'd of late Years, that its intrinſick value did not amount to two thirds, ſometimes not to one half of what it ought to be. As nothing is more pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deſtructive to Commerce than the adulteration of Money, ſo theſe Diſorders made many grumble againſt the Government, it being a cuſtomary thing for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People to impute any publick Diſaſter to the miſ-management of thoſe at the Helm, which was alſo improved by a Party, who inſinuated into the People that great ſtore of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coin was Tranſported into <hi>Holland.</hi> The Agents of the King of <hi>England</hi> believing the preſent juncture very favourable to their Deſign, ſet all their Engines at work for his Reſtauration. They brought over many to their ſide, ſome out of Novelty, others being moved by a ſeaſonable Repentance, others out of Affection to their King joined in the Deſign of reſtoring him to the Throne. They could ſcarce have wiſh'd for a more favourable Opportunity, the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) having left the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom deſtitute of Troops, and without a Fleet to guard the Coaſts. All his Troops were tranſported to <hi>Flanders,</hi> the grand Fleet was at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and a good Squadron of his beſt Ships lately gone out of the <hi>Downs,</hi> to join thoſe in the <hi>Streights.</hi> The King of <hi>England</hi> encourag'd by theſe hopes of Succeſs, came to <hi>Calais</hi> with a Body of Sixteen Thouſand Men of old Troops, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:95697:160"/>the Command of ſeveral experienc'd Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, who were ready to Embark at an hours warning. But the Winds proving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary for ſome time, the whole Deſign was diſcover'd, and we loſt at once both the time and hopes of putting it in Execution. For no ſooner had the <hi>Dutch</hi> received In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of this intended deſcent; but they put to Sea with a Squadron of twelve ſtout Ships, which cruiſed before <hi>Calais.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> K. <hi>William</hi> III. without ſhewing the leaſt Concern at the greatneſs of the Danger, ſoon found means to diſperſe theſe Clouds. He ſecured many ſuſpected Perſons, recalled his Fleets, and ſome of his Troops out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ſecur'd the Sea-Coaſts on that ſide, which was moſt expoſed to danger, with a good Body of the Militia. A Plot, when once diſcover'd, ſeldom takes effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and in lieu of proving deſtructive to thoſe againſt whom it was intended, prroves ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the chief means of their Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Both the Houſes of Parliament gave upon this occaſion new Demonſtrations of their Zeal and firm Adherence to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) by entring into an Aſſociation not only to maintain his Intereſt againſt all Pretenders, but alſo to revenge his Death if he ſhould happen to be ſnatch'd away by ſome ſiniſter Attempt againſt his Life. Having received theſe freſh Aſſurances of their Zeal for his Perſon and Intereſt, he took ſuch ſure mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to prevent all future Danger of this kind, that without any further delay he paſſed over into <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="279" facs="tcp:95697:160"/>
            <p>At his Arrival in <hi>Flanders</hi> he found the King's Armies in the Field before him, and in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Territories. The King having taken a Reſolution to be upon the defenſive, and ſent his Orders to the Marſhal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> who was to Command the <hi>French</hi> Army in the <hi>Lower Flanders,</hi> to poſſeſs himſelf at the beginning of the Campaign of ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Poſt, from whence he might both obſerve the Enemies Motions, and prevent their Deſigns, and ſubſiſt in their Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries till the end of the Campaign. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my near the <hi>Meuſe</hi> was Commanded by the Marſhal <hi>de Bouflers,</hi> who, purſuant to the King's Orders, had divided his Army into four ſeveral Bodies, at ſuch a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as to be able to join upon any occaſion, and at the ſame time to cover the <hi>French</hi> Conqueſts. All the meaſures taken by the Confederates being broken by theſe ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Precautions, they were forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their own Territories, all the Summer long, without being able to undertake a Siege, or come to an Engagement, though they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd more formidable now than ever. Their Fleet conſiſted of an Hundred and Thirty Sail, but did no other feats but to burn a few Houſes at <hi>Calais,</hi> near the Sands of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and at St. <hi>Martins.</hi> They had three Armies in the Low-Countries, one conſiſting of five and twenty, or thirty Thouſand Men, under the Command of the Prince of <hi>Vaudemont</hi> in the <hi>Lower Flanders,</hi> which however was not ſtrong enough to Encounter the Marſhal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> who Forraged to the very Gates of <hi>Ghent,</hi> and exacted Contributions from all the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:95697:161"/>circumjacent Countries. Their Grand Army at leaſt half as ſtrong again, threatned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one, ſometimes another Place with a Siege, but could not meet with a favourable opportunity to put it in Execution. A third Army of eighteen or twenty Thouſand Men, all <hi>Germans,</hi> advanced towards the ſide of <hi>Namur,</hi> under the Command of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of <hi>Heſſe-Caſsal.</hi> They remain'd in that Poſt for about a Month, when for want of Pay, or opportunity of being employed in <hi>Flanders,</hi> they returned towards the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither did the Confederates act with much better Succeſs on the <hi>German</hi> ſide. The Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> keeping cloſe within his Lines till the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> not thinking it adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to meet the Marſhal de <hi>Choiſeul,</hi> who had paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> Army, and ſtayed on this ſide near ſix Weeks. After the return of the Landgrave of <hi>Heſse,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> paſſed the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the reſt, Marched towards <hi>Philips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh,</hi> without attempting any thing againſt the Place. They afterwards advanced nearer the Marſhal, but ſpent the reſt of their time in Cannonading one anothers Camp, without coming to an Engagement.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> had but a ſmall Army in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> more conſiderable for the goodneſs of his Troops than their Number. Yet he remained Maſter of the Field all that Campaign, being belov'd and eſteem'd by the Inhabitants of the Country, and dreaded by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> He defeated the Body of their Cavalry, much Superiour in number of Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons to his. He demoliſh'd many of their
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:95697:161"/>Caſtles which ſerved them for places of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. He obſerved ſo cloſely the Motions of their Army, that he encloſed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Mountains and their Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where, without ſtriking a Stroak, they loſt more Men than they could have done in an Engagement.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> the Marſhal <hi>de Catinat</hi> appear'd in the Field with a very numerous Army, compoſed of ſome of our beſt Troops, the King having taken a reſolution either to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all the Country as yet remaining under the Obedience of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> or to oblige that Prince to accept of a Peace. So ſoon as the Enemy receiv'd Intelligence that the <hi>French</hi> were preparing to paſs the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they employ'd a great number of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to cover the City of <hi>Turin</hi> againſt any Attempt, by making ſtrong Lines and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, they carried all the common Cattle into places of Security, and by their Army, and numerous Parties which they ſent abroad every Day, endeavour'd to hinder our Communication with <hi>Pignerol.</hi> Our Army finding nothing elſe to ſubſiſt on but what they were ſupply'd with by our Convoys, did ſuffer Extreamly in their March, which was not very haſty, we being at the ſame time in Treaty with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and upon the point of concluding it.</p>
            <p>After the Breach of the Truce, the King had in his <hi>Manifeſt</hi> ſufficiently teſtified his Intention of Sacrificing all his Conqueſts to the re-eſtabliſhment of the publick Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that he had not taken up Arms to enlarge his Frontiers, but to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:95697:162"/>againſt the Attempts of the Confederate Princes. Upon the ſame ſcore it was, that both before the Siege of <hi>Philipsbourgh</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reduction not only of that Place, but alſo of the whole Palatinate, he preſſed the Allies to change the Truce made at <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> in the Year 1684. into a laſting Peace. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame account alſo after taking <hi>Villa Franca Nice,</hi> and <hi>Montmelian,</hi> he offer'd the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to reſtore to him all the Conqueſts he had made on that ſide. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi> being demoliſh'd ſince that time, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Inclinations began to bend ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards a Peace. Peace is ſo deſirable in it ſelf, that when offer'd ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd. Happy is that Prince who knows how to improve ſuch an Opportunity to his own Advantage.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Duke made ſome Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the next Spring to Beſiege <hi>Pignerol,</hi> but his Intention was rather to oblige us to demoliſh it than to reduce it by force of Arms. He had Eſpouſed one of the Daughters of the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> only Brother to our King, who having no Daughters, had Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the eldeſt of his Nieces to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the ſecond to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> died without Iſſue, but the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> had had three Princeſſes; to one of theſe the King reſolv'd to Marry the eldeſt of his Grandſons, to renew by this Marriage the ancient Alliance betwixt <hi>France</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Alliance and the preſent Advantage of removing theſe inconveniencies which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the War at ſo great a diſtance, made the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:95697:162"/>King conſent to the demoliſhing of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and to reſtore the Duke into the immediate Poſſeſſion of all his Territories, except <hi>Suſa, Nice,</hi> and <hi>Montmelian,</hi> which were to be left in the King's Hands till the Concluſion of the general Peace.</p>
            <p>The Duke on the other Hand oblig'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a ſeparate Article,
<note place="margin">Peace with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </note> to propoſe to the Confederates a Neutrality in <hi>Italy,</hi> and if they refuſed to accept of it, to join his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with <hi>France</hi> to oblige them to it.</p>
            <p>During the Treaty with <hi>Savoy,</hi> the King had granted a Truce for one Month, which afterwards was prolonged at the Requeſt of the Pope, and the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> who were not willing to let ſlip this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that offer'd, to rid their hands of the <hi>German,</hi> and other Forreign Forces.</p>
            <p>But the Confederates were ſo far from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Dukes Propoſitions, that on the contrary they left no ſtone unturn'd, by threats, and Promiſes, to perſwade him to alter his Reſolution. But he ſtood immova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all theſe Inſinuations, and the time of the Truce being expir'd,

            </p>
            <p>The Marſhal <hi>de Catinat</hi> Commanded both theſe Armies under the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Trenches being opened before the Place towards the end of <hi>September,</hi> we cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on our Works with ſuch Succeſs, that the Place was juſt upon the point of Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating,

               </note> when a Meſſenger arrived in the Camp on the ninth day of <hi>October,</hi> with this agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <p>And that the <hi>German</hi> Forces ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their March, in order to return into their own Country, the ſame day that the King's Army in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhould return into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King gain'd great Advantages by the Peace of <hi>Italy;</hi> Thirty Thouſand Men of his beſt Troops, with a great General, who had hitherto been Employed on that ſide, might be made uſe of with much leſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence againſt the Enemy in another place, which muſt needs oblige them then to make a Peace with us, or to continue the War with more Vigour, and greater Expences than before.</p>
            <p>We reap'd alſo another Advantage by it, which ought not to be paſs'd by in Silence, which was the Princeſs <hi>Maria Adalaida,</hi>

But to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of this Campaign there appear'd more diſpoſition in the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates for a Peace, than before; and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> ſhew'd much eagerneſs for it, the Allies were for the moſt part diſcouraged by the many Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments they had met with, and moſt of them having no particular Intereſt in the War, began to hearken to theſe Propoſals, which were made on our King's behalf, to give Satisfaction to ſome of the Confederate Princes; thus every thing ſeem'd to tend towards the Concluſion of a general Peace, if an un-foreſeen Obſtacle had not overturn'd all theſe fair hopes.</p>

                  <hi>Charles</hi> II. K. of <hi>ſpain.</hi>
               </note> the preſent King of <hi>Spain,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to fall ill in the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> ſo as to have three ſeveral Relapſes in leſs than ſix Weeks time. This Prince having no Iſſue, and all <hi>Europe</hi> taking Intereſt in the Quarrel which was like to ariſe after his Death about the Succeſſion; the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſhew'd not much forwardneſs to bring it to a Concluſion, till after the recovery of this Monarch. It was perhaps upon this ſcore
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:95697:164"/>that the Miniſters of the Emperor, and of ſome of the reſt of the Confederate Princes, found means to raiſe many difficulties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Paſſes, and the place where the Ambaſſadours were to meet to carry on the Negotiation of Peace. The Conferences were already begun at the <hi>Hague,</hi> as being the Center where the Miniſters of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſederacy uſed to meet, beſides that the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhewed more Inclination for the Peace than the reſt, and made uſe of all their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to promote ſo great a Work. Money began to be ſo ſcarce among them, that they were hardly put to it to find means for the raiſing of new Troops, to furniſh their <hi>Quota</hi> of Men and Money, which made up the largeſt ſhare of the whole Confederacy. They were alſo under ſome apprehenſions that the Catholick Princes might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon, either by the Mediation of the Pope, or of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to conclude a ſeparate Peace. For ſince the Concluſion of the Peace in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Emperor's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter remain'd ſtill at <hi>Turin.</hi> The Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> had alſo taken ſeveral Journeys thither; the Count <hi>de Teſſe</hi> reſided there in our King's behalf, and the Marſhal <hi>de Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi> had ſtayed there for ſome time before he repaſſed the <hi>Alpes.</hi> The long ſtay of theſe Miniſters in a Court which ſo lately had changed its Intereſt, their frequent Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, the many Meſſengers that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſent forwards and backwards, betwixt <hi>Paris, Vienna,</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> raiſed no ſmall jealouſie in the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and made them fear, leſt, if the Emperour, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:95697:165"/>Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the other <hi>Catholick</hi> Princes ſhould make a ſeparate Peace, they would be left a Sacrifice to <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whilſt theſe debates laſted, both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties began to make greater Preparations than ever for the Proſecution of the War.
<note place="margin">Campaign of 1697.</note> The King's Power appear'd more formidable than it did nine Years ago, for he had more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, more Troops, and better Officers, than at the beginning of the War. His Forces, both in Garriſons, and in the Field, were counted to conſiſt of four hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Men, to wit, three hundred and fifty Thouſand Foot, and threeſcore and ten Thouſand Horſe, without reckoning thoſe Employed in the Sea-Service, who were no leſs conſiderable this Year than at any time before, the King having applied all his Care to Arm in all his Ports, and Equip all the biggeſt and beſt of his Ships. The Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates on the other ſide having taken a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make their laſt Efforts this Campaign, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) and the <hi>Dutch</hi> made a defenſive League with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> by Vertue of which he was obliged to furniſh them with a certain number of Troops, and a Squadron of Men of War.</p>
            <p>But in the midſt of all theſe vaſt Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Plenipotentiaries of all the Princes that were engag'd in this Bloody War, began to open the Conferences for the Concluſion of the Peace. <hi>Delft</hi> and the <hi>Hague</hi> were pitch'd upon for the Places of Reſidence of theſe Miniſters, and the Caſtle of <hi>Riſwick,</hi> which lies betwixt theſe two Places, to hold their
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:95697:165"/>Conferdnces in. A conſiderable time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the opening of theſe Conferences,
<note place="margin">Neutrall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia.</hi>
               </note> a Negotiation had been ſet on Foot at <hi>Turin,</hi> to conclude a Neutrality for <hi>Catalonia.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> cannot be more ſenſibly touch'd in any part of their Dominions than in <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> which lying ſo near to the Center of the Kingdom, and Danger threatning from that ſide, puts the People of <hi>Spain</hi> into a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is more dreadful among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> than other Nations. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> wanted the neceſſary Funds for the carrying on of the War; the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> having not disbanded any of his Troops, either becauſe matters were thus concerted betwixt our Court and him, or becauſe he intended to improve the preſent Conjuncture to his Advantage, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could draw but few of their Troops out of the <hi>Milaneze.</hi> The Confederates had no Fleet in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,</hi> and were conſequently not in a Condition to ſuccour them with any of their Troops in <hi>Catalonia;</hi> beſides, that theſe Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Auxiliaries prov'd more troubleſome to the Inhabitants than the Enemy; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all theſe diſadvantages the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> were inclin'd to accept of this Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, if it had not been repreſented to them by the Emperor's Miniſters, that if our King ſhould be freed at once from the War, both near the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, it would be ſo great an Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Strength, that the Confederacy would be reduc'd to a neceſſity of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Ruin by the Concluſion of a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Peace: Theſe Conſiderations were
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:95697:166"/>ſo prevailing with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they neglected their own Intereſt for that of the Confederacy, and refuſed to accept of the Neutrality with <hi>Catalonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The glorious ſucceſs of the <hi>French</hi> Arms for theſe nine or ten Years laſt paſt, had given new occaſion of Jealouſie to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror The Continuation of the War was a plauſible pretence to augment his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Empire; he had all the Reaſon in the World to be afraid of the ill ſtate of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Health, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Conſtitution; he did alſo imagine that after the Concluſion of the Peace, the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Princes would not be very forward to aſſiſt him againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> all which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements were ſufficient to diminiſh the Emperor's Inclinations for a Peace.</p>
            <p>It was ſuppoſed that the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> (K. <hi>William</hi> III.) was alſo rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to continue the War, but conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that both the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſir'd it; there was not any reaſon which could oblige him to oppoſe this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation. For the ſeveral Plots which had been contrived againſt him ſince his Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Throne, the decay of Commerce, the vaſt quantity of falſe and clipt Money and the ſcarcity of good Coin had cauſed' ſuch Confuſions in <hi>England,</hi> as could not be better repair'd than by a ſpeedy Peace, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuſtain'd ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Loſſes, both by our Privateers, and the heavy Taxes, that many of their richeſt Merchants were ruin'd by the War. Add to this that the People in <hi>Holland</hi> were
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:95697:166"/>ſo preſſing for a Peace, that for fear the States-General ſhould be prevail'd upon to conſent to a ſeparate Peace with <hi>France,</hi> the Emperor and the other Princes judged it moſt adviceable not to delay any longer to ſend their Plenipotentiaries to aſſiſt at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Conferences.</p>
            <p>The King had for ſome time before ſent <hi>Francis de Calliere,</hi> a perſon in whom he put a ſingular Confidence, to the <hi>Hague,</hi> to adjuſt the main Preliminary Points with the States General of the United Provinces, and to remove all Obſtacles which might retard, or obſtruct this grand Affair, he kept upon the defenſive, for fear of raiſing new Jealouſies againſt him among the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. But finding that this only ſerved for a means to retard than promote the Peace, ſome of the Confederates being buoyed up with the vain hopes of obtaining more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Conditions by theſe delays, he took a reſolution to act with more Vigour this Campaign.</p>
            <p>Since the end of the laſt Campaign the King had ordered his Magazines upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> to be fill'd with all manner of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: The <hi>French</hi> Forces which hitherto had been Employ'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> were put into Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Quarters in <hi>Alſace,</hi> and other adjacent Countries, and our Troops had been in Motion all the Winter, the better to amuſe the Enemy. The Neighbouring Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly Alarm'd at theſe vaſt Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cauſed their Territories to be cover'd by ſtrong Entrenchments, defended by a vaſt number of Palliſadoes; and Batteries, with
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:95697:167"/>Redoubts, and Forts built on all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Avenues, as if they all were to ſuſtain the whole Force of <hi>France</hi> the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Campaign. A Rumour being alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly ſpread abroad, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the Motions of our Forces on that ſide, that the King intended to have two great Armies in <hi>Germany,</hi> one near the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Rhine,</hi> to give a Diverſion to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the other under the Marſhal <hi>de Catinat,</hi> to undertake a Siege upon the <hi>Lower-Rhine,</hi> the Confederates fortified <hi>Mayence,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided this as well as other places thereabouts with fufficient Garriſons. This Rumor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till towards the end of <hi>April,</hi> the King having managed the whole Deſign with ſomuch Conduct and Secrecy, that the Generals, who, were to ſerve under the Marſhal <hi>de Catinat,</hi> were upon the Road to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Germany,</hi> in expectation to make the Campaign there, when they receiv'd Orders to the contrary; and that they ſhould with all ſpeed repair to <hi>Flanders,</hi> whither the ſaid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal was gone to form the Siege of <hi>Aeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Enterprize was look'd upon as the moſt glorious that could be undertaken,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Aeth.</note> the Place being ſtrongly fortified with eight Baſtions, ſurrounded with a broad and deep Ditch, full of Water. It was the ſixteenth day of <hi>May,</hi> when the Town was Inveſted, at which time, there was a Garriſon in it of three thouſand ſeven hundred Men. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a place attack'd with more precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo much vigour; at the ſame time the King having given expreſs Orders to the Marſhal, to ſpare as much as poſſible could be
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:95697:167"/>his Troops, but to play againſt the Place the more furiouſly with his great Artillery. But the beſieged made but a feeble Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; they fired not very briskly, nor made one Sally, when our Men made the Aſſault upon the covert Way, they left their Poſt after the firſt Diſcharge; ſo that as ſoon as we had made two breaches large enough to mount them, this ſtrong Place, which by reaſon of its many Outworks,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Surrender of</hi> Aeth.</note> was fear'd would coſt us a great many Men, ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by Compoſition the 6th day of <hi>June,</hi> in thirteen days after opening of the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, with the loſs only of a hundred Men on our Side.</p>
            <p>The Confederates had at the ſame two great Armies in <hi>Flanders,</hi> being both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted at a hundred and twenty thouſand Men. Our King, to diſappoint the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies deſign of relieving the Place, had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Marſhal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> to poſt himſelf on that ſide, where there was the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of danger. The Marſhal <hi>de Bouflers</hi> was Encamped on the other ſide of the Town, and three other Bodies were to guard ſome other Avenues leading to it; all which were poſted at ſuch convenient diſtance, as to be able to ſecond one another in caſe of an Attack; ſo ſoon as the Enemy had been advertiſed of the Siege, they advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards our Lines, but whither it were that they fear'd the Deſertion of many of their Soldiers, who were very ill paid, or that they did not think it for their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to hazard a Battle at this juncture of time, when the Peace was ſo near a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:95697:168"/>for fear, that if the Succeſs ſhould not anſwer their Expectation, they ſhould be forced to reſt contented with the leſs advantageous Conditions, they divided their Army into ſeveral Bodies, the better to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their other Places in <hi>Flanders,</hi> without attempting the Relief of <hi>Aeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after the taking of <hi>Aeth,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a freſh Reinforcement of eighteen thouſand Men, but notwithſtanding their vaſt Number, they Entrenched themſelves in their Camp, which they made impregnable by many Redoubts and Batteries. The <hi>French</hi> Army's continued all this Summer in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Territories, without being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtubr'd by the Confederates, who avoided a Battle or Engagement. The remaining part of the Campaign was ſpent without any further Action, the Allies ſeeming to have no other Aim, than to prevent our Forces from undertaking any thing of moment; and both Parties being actually inclin'd to expect the iſſue of the Siege of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and of the Diet Aſſembled in <hi>Poland,</hi> for the chuſing of a Succeſſor to their lately deceaſed King <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Sobieski,</hi> Grand Marſhal of <hi>Poland,</hi> ow'd his Elevation to the Throne of <hi>Poland,</hi> not ſo much to his own Credit and Intereſt, as to our King's Protection, and the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Management of the then Biſhop of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:95697:168"/>This King acquir'd immortal Glory about nine Years after, when he left his Kingdom, and marched in the year 1683, to the relief of <hi>Viena.</hi> But ever ſince that time he had altred his meaſures, and in lieu of proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the War with vigour againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, had given himſelf over to Idleneſs, his main Care being to heap up ſuch Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for his Children, as to put them in a Condition either to obtain the Crown after his Death,
<note place="margin">John So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bieski, <hi>K. of</hi> Poland.</note> or at leaſt to put them beyond the want of it; whereas the beſt Treaſure he could have left to his Children, would have been to bleſs them with the Love of the People. But theſe gave ſuch evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the little eſteem they had for his Family, by pillaging his Eſtate du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Interregnum, that it ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to the World, that his memory was become odious to them.</p>
            <p>After the Death of this Prince, a general Diet was call'd together, in order to chuſe a Succeſſor to the Crown. At this critical Conjuncture, when moſt Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> were engaged in a War, it was no wonder, if each Party pretended to maintain their Intereſt at this Election. The Election of a King of <hi>Poland</hi> inclining either to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of <hi>France,</hi> or the Confederacy, being look'd upon at this juncture of time of ſuch Conſequence, as to carry along with it no ſmall Influence towards the raiſing or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Hopes of the Confederate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; each Party therefore were not ſparing in making Intrigues for or againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of ſuch a Perſon, as they either wiſh'd
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:95697:169"/>to be elevated, or excluded from the Throne of <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the reſt that pretended to the Crown, was the preſent Czar of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> His Empire is of a very vaſt extent,

                  <hi>Prince</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis <hi>of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> This Prince was a great Maſter of the Art of War, and had had great Succeſs againſt the Infidels in <hi>Hungary,</hi> whom he had vanquiſh'd at ſeveral times. The Emperour, in acknowledgment of his Services; and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (K. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> III.) out of a particular Reſpect for his perſon, would without all queſtion, have eſpouſed his Intereſt; if by joynt-conſent of the Confederates, it had not been judged more adviſable to ſupport the Faction of Prince <hi>James Sobieski,</hi>

               <hi>Bavaria.</hi> Every thing ſeem'd to concur for his Advantage; He was eldeſt Son to the late King, he wanted not Riches to purchaſe the Voices and Protection of the Great ones.

For, his near Alliance with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> had raiſed a Jealouſy in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lords, leſt, he ſhould, when once their King, improve it to their diſadvantage, and be encourag'd by the Neighbourhood of the Emperour to make uſe of his Power, to the prejudice of their Liberty. The preſſing Sollicitations made in his behalf by the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Princes, began to be ſuſpected by the Populace, by reaſon of a certain Jealouſy and Emulation, which is always to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved betwixt two Potent neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He was as Liberal in his Promiſes to pay the Debts of the Crown, in caſe he was elected King, as profuſe in his Money to gain the Hearts of the <hi>Poles,</hi> but in vain, nothing being able to remove the Averſion they had conceived againſt him.</p>
            <p>The Confederates finding the <hi>Poles</hi> thus diſpoſed, began to deſpair of the Succeſs of the Prince, for which Reaſon they raiſed a new Faction, for the Elector of <hi>Saxony.</hi> The Elector promiſed to turn Catholick, and there

He promiſed alſo to maintain at his own Coſt, fifteen thouſand Men, and never to make Peace with the <hi>Turks,</hi> till he had reſtored all what they had taken from the <hi>Poles.</hi> Theſe ſpecious Offers would perhaps have influenced the <hi>Poles</hi> to prefer the Elector before the reſt, if the Eyes and Hearts of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility had not been guided by the real Proſpect of more ſolid Advantages.</p>

Theſe great Qualifications, which made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry favourable Impreſſions in the hearts of a
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:95697:170"/>War-like People, received a new Luſtre by our King's Recommendation to the Chief Men of <hi>Poland.</hi> But, this Negotiation met with no ſmall Difficulties, as being oppoſed by almoſt all the reſt of the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> The Miniſters of theſe <hi>Princes</hi> inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated without intermiſſion to the <hi>Poles,</hi> that to chuſe a <hi>French Prince,</hi> would be to put all their Neighbours into a continual Alarm; that this, whether true or falſe, would at one time or other, turn to the diſadvantage of <hi>Poland,</hi> which thereby would change its preſent happy Condition for the Miſeries of a long War. That their Riches and Forces would be employed to promote the ambitious Deſigns of <hi>France;</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> tho' inveſted with the Royal Dignity, not being diſcharged from the Obligations due to our King, whom both in point of Gratitude and Intereſt, he could not be able to refuſe, whatever he deſired.</p>
            <p>They were alſo not ſparing both in their Threats and Promiſes; but the King's Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt prevailing over all their Intrigues, the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> was Elected by the plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Votes. For of thirty two Palatinates, that appear'd in the Field, eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty declared for him, the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> having only four on his ſide. This Prince being ſo much ſuperior in Number of Voices to his Competitor, was immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gueſna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            <pb n="300" facs="tcp:95697:171"/>
            <p>But the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> againſt all the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Kingdom, was likewiſe proclaimed King by the Biſhop of <hi>Kujavia,</hi> who falſely pretended to this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

                  <hi>Elector of</hi> Saxony <hi>proclaimed King of</hi> Poland.</note> endeavouring to maintain themſelves by Force and violent Means. The moſt ſpeedy way to diſperſe theſe Clouds, and to reſtore a perfect Calm in the Kingdom, and to remove all future Danger of any civil Commotions, was the calling of a new Diet, to determine the Difference concerning this Election, and to maintain the Prince <hi>de Conty</hi> in his Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to confirm his Election by the Authority, if not of all, at leaſt of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Number of the Palatinates.</p>
            <p>The iſſue of this grand Affair kept all <hi>Europe</hi> in ſuſpence for ſome time, but the Siege of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> which had been carried on for two Months together with the utmoſt Vigour,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Siege of</hi> Barcelona.</note> was look'd upon by moſt to be of no leſs Conſequence. <hi>Barcelona</hi> is one of the moſt Conſiderable Forts in all <hi>Spain.</hi> It is a very large, rich, populous City, Famous for its Traffick. It is tollerably well Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied on the Land ſide, having a Fort at a quarter of a Leagues diſtance from the Town, built upon a ſteep Rock. The Place was at that time provided ſufficiently with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, beſides which, they received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Supplies, the Town being not begirt on that ſide where the Fort lay. The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon conſiſted of eleven thouſand diſciplin'd Troops, beſides four thouſand <hi>Miquelets.</hi> They play'd without Intermiſſion with their
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:95697:171"/>Cannons, Bombs, Granado's, and other Fire-Arms, and ſometimes made four Sallies in one Night. They diſputed every Inch of Ground with us in their Outworks, ſome of which they retook twice or thrice, and at laſt made new Entrenchments within the old Baſtions, and inſpite of the Prayers of the Inhabitants, and Threats of the common People, they ſtood it out, with an unparalel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bravery to the laſt Extremity. The Count <hi>de la Corſana,</hi> Governour of the City, and the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe Darmſtadt,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief of the Garriſon, acquir'd immortal Glory in the Defence of this Place. On the other hand, what Pen is able to give due Praiſes to thoſe who vanquiſhed ſuch brave Men, who by their invincible Courage overcame their Reſolution, and were not diſcourag'd by the Fatigues and Dangers of ſo long and bloody a Siege? The number of the Beſieged did bear no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Beſiegers, the Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme</hi>'s Army conſiſting of no more than thirty thouſand Men, at the beginning of the Siege, and the Reinforcement which he received from <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Languedock,</hi> not above eight or nine thouſand ſtrong, being all <hi>Militia.</hi> But what is unacceſſible to a General, who has an equal ſhare of Courage and Conduct, who knows how to manage his Troops to the utmoſt Advantage, who by his Example teaches them to out-brave all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues and Dangers, and to be rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged than diſmay'd at the Bravery of their Enemies?</p>
            <pb n="302" facs="tcp:95697:172"/>
            <p>Thus the Siege was carried on with all imaginable Vigour, tho' for want of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent number of Forces, we could not carry our Lines quite round the Place. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Way was attack'd three ſeveral times,
<note place="margin">Attacks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Way.</note> and in three ſeveral places. In the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault we lodged our ſelves upon one of the Angles, but were beaten back from the two others. We had a ſecond Aſſault the next day, but without Succeſs, not being able to maintain us in our Poſts till the third. Then the Batteries on the Counterſcarp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play moſt furiouſly; The Bombs and red hot Bullets laid two thirds of the Town in Aſhes, and the dead Carcaſſes buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Ruines ſent forth ſuch a nauſeous Scent, as infected the whole City. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had made Breaches both in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and Courtines; but the Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme</hi> did not think it convenient to give the general Aſſault, till he had routed the Viceroy, to take away all hopes of relief by Land, from the Beſieged, of which they had no hopes left by Sea, the Allies having at that time no Fleet in the <hi>Mediteranean,</hi> and a Squadron of nine <hi>French</hi> Men of War, many Frigats and thirty Gallies laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Port. The Count <hi>d' Eſtree</hi> was Commander in Chief of this Squadron; the Forces and the Officers that were embarqu'd on board of theſe Ships, did great Service in this Siege; The taking of the covered Way in the third Aſſault, being as chiefly owing to the Valour of <hi>James de Noailles,</hi> Lieutenant General of the <hi>French</hi> Gallies. All the remaining hopes of the Beſieged,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:95697:172"/>were in the Relief they expected from the Viceroy, who kept the Field with four or five thouſand regular Troops, and a good Body of <hi>Miquelets.</hi> They had alſo another ſmall Body of about ſeven or eight thouſand Horſe, and a thouſand Foot, which being poſted betwixt the Mountains, made frequent Incurſions to annoy and intercept our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys, and to prevent our Peaſants from car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying Proviſions to our Camp.</p>
            <p>The Enemies Deſign was to attack our Lines in two or three places at once, and to force them, if poſſible, under the favour of a General Sally, to be made by the whole Garriſon at the ſame time.
<note place="margin">The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Army ſurpriſed.</note> The Duke <hi>de Vendoſme,</hi> thinking it the ſafeſt way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them in their Deſign, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Intelligence by his Spyes, that they were very careleſly Encamped, marched out two hours before break of Day with ſix thouſand of his beſt Men, and at the ſame time fent a Body of three hundred Horſe, two hundred Dragoons; and a thouſand Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiliers, under the Bommand of the Count <hi>d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſson,</hi> to ſurpriſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were poſted betwixt the Mountains.</p>
            <p>The Cavalry and Outguards being cut in pieces, the Duke advanced without the leaſt Reſiſtance to the Viceroy's Quarter, where there was nothing but Confuſion, as may eaſily be ſuppoſed to be the Effects of ſuch a Surprize. Every one was for following the Example of the Viceroy, who ſaved himſelf in his Shirt, without being able to take along with him his Papers, or Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore, in which was a good Sum of Gold.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:95697:173"/>Two or three hundred of the braveſt among them, who made ſome reſiſtance, were cut in pieces, and the reſt diſperſed in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. The whole Camp, with all their Baggage fell a Prey to our Soldiers, who burnt their Tents and every thing elſe that was not portable.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſon,</hi> having at the ſame time had the good Fortune, to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from their Poſt in the Mountains, we had all the reaſon to believe that the Beſieged, being diſcouraged by this ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, would alter their meaſures, and give over their Deſign of holding out to the laſt Extremity.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aſſault up on</hi> Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona.</note> But we found our ſelves deceiv'd in our hopes, for they received us with incredible Bravery, as we were giving the Aſſault about a Week after, upon the Breaches of the two Baſtions. They retook one of theſe Baſtions with great Slaughter, and after they were drove from thence a ſecond time, retreated into a ſtrong En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment they had made behind the Breach of the Baſtion. Thus we were to encounter the Danger of a new Siege, there being behind the Entrenchment a ſtrong old Wall, fortified with Towers. Our Miners were ſet at Work, and every thing ready for a general Aſſault, when the Beſieged were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſummon'd to a Surrender; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being in the leaſt terrified at the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that threatned them in caſe the Town ſhould be be taken by Aſſault; they refuſed to hearken to a Capitulation, till at laſt, being overcome by the Lamentations of the Cirizens, and the Conſideration of their
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:95697:173"/>preſent Condition, which was ſuch as not to be able to ſuſtain another Aſſault, without hazarding all, they accepted of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions offer'd them by the Duke <hi>de Vendoſme,</hi> who, to ſhew the Eſteem he had for their Bravery, allow'd them very honourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, to wit, to march out thro' the Breach, with ſix Mortars, and thirty pieces of Cannon.

            <p>It was was much about the ſame time, that we receiveed the welcome News of the good Succeſs of an Expedition againſt <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena,</hi> a Place belonging to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-jealous of their great Riches and vaſt Poſſeſſions in the new World, that they do not ſuffer any Foreigner among them there. This Project had been in Debate ſeveral times before; but never came to Maturity, till the Sieur <hi>de Ponty</hi> obtain'd Leave from the King, to undertake this Eppediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Perſon. The King, to encourage the Deſign, provided the Ships; many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons furniſhing their Quota for the Equipment of them, in proportion to the Share they expected to have in the Booty.

            <p>The Expedition made much Noiſe in all Parts of the World, every body ſtanding amaz'd at the Boldneſs of the Buckaneers, it being chiefly owing to their Bravery, that this dangerous Expedition was brought to a happy iſſue, tho' carried on with a much leſs Number of Ships and Men than ſeem'd proportionable to the Greatneſs of the Enterprize.</p>
